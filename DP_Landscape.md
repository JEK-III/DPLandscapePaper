# Abstract
The movement to incorporate datasets into the scholarly record as ‘first class’ research products (validated, preserved, cited, and credited) has been slowly building momentum for some time, but the pace of developments picked up substantially in the last year.  Data publications are beginning to spring up all over the place, but there are still significant debates over formats, processes, and terminology.  This article will give an overview of the initiatives underway and the current conversation, highlighting places where consensus seems to have been reached and issues still in contention.

Data publication implementations follow variety of models that differ in, among other things, what kind of documentation is published, where the data resides relative to the documentation, and what validation is performed.  Data can be published as a standalone product, as supplemental material to a traditional journal article, or with a descriptive “data paper”. Confusing the situation, terms are often used by different initiatives to refer to partially overlapping concepts.  The term ‘published’ always means that the data is public and citable, but it may or may not mean peer reviewed.  In turn, data ‘peer  review’ can refer to substantially different processes– although data paper referee guidelines are all fairly similar.  There is substantial agreement on the elements of a dataset citation (which closely resembles that of a journal article) but a variety of solutions for citing subsets of datasets or datasets that change over time.  Finally, some are already looking past data publication to other metaphors, such as ‘data as software’, for solutions to unsolved problems.

# Outline
##Why publish data?
Bring data into the scholarly record.
Enable reuse and encourage sharing

"Data Publication" is a 

##What does “data publication” mean?
Generally agreed upon properties:
Available– now and for the indefinite future
Citable– a citation made now will work for the indefinite future
Up for debate:
Trustworthy– certified “good” by some community standard
shared vs. published vs. Published	


## What does a data publication look like?
### Standalone
	Open Context and NASA PDS peer review data.
	Figshare makes data available and citable, but doesn’t validate it in any way.

### Traditional article
	Supplemental material
	Dryad

Data Papers
Growing rapidly
Everyone agrees on what they are not: results, analysis, or conclusions.
	Currently, about half are dedicated data journals.  The other half publish multiple article types.
Nature Scientific Data
	GeoScience Data Journal
	The number of journals publishing data papers is growing rapidly.
	Most journals require the data to be in a trusted repository.  A few handle it themselves.


	
## How does data peer review work?
	Distinction can be drawn between technical and scientific review (Callaghan 2012)
	Data and paper are generally reviewed together as a package.
	An exception is GigaScience, which assigns a data reviewer.
About half of data journals consider impact / novelty.
When guidelines are provided, they are roughly similar.
The process, however, is variable– ranging from traditional to postpublication experiments of F1000 Research.
Open context provides a multi-tiered evaluation system.

## How does data citation work?
### Simple case
### Deep citation	
### Dynamic data

## Beyond data publication
Data as software
	Version control
	Collaboration
