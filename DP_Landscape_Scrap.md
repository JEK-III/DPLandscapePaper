The key aspect of a citation here is that it can be used to identify and locate the dataset from now into the indefinite future; assignment of a persistent identifier like a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is the usual way to accomplish this.

Science publishing had baked into it the notion that access must persist into the future for the use of future researchers.
Preserving access to print journals has long been the job of the library, but that's changing like everything else.  

A dataset that can only be accessed with a paid subscription or after accepting a use agreement can be said to have been published, but one that is provided by its creator over email is not.
The status of a dataset located on a researcher's personal website is not entirely clear.

###what do I really want to say about availability?
Have to provide consistent access without a human gatekeeper
Consistent means into the future.
Your website is not a good way to do this.
In practice, you need to publish from a repository.

What are the characteristics of repositories that matter?
-IRs, discipline specific, and new deals like figshare and dryad
-preservation, access, discovery
-preservation = "tustworthy" TRAC, Data seal of approval etc.
-access = open or semi-restricted.
- -handling sensitive data
-discovery
- -discipline specific are good for this
- -IRs and other are wildly variable

###consider Open Context vs. tDAR 
as an illustrative example
