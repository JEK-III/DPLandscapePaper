	abstract = {While cell signaling devotees tend to think of the endoplasmic reticulum ({ER)} as a Ca(2+) store, those who study protein synthesis tend to see it more as site for protein maturation, or even degradation when proteins do not fold properly. These two worldviews collide when inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ({IP(3))} receptors are activated, since in addition to acting as release channels for stored {ER} Ca(2+), {IP(3)} receptors are rapidly destroyed via the {ER-associated} degradation ({ERAD)} pathway, a ubiquitination- and proteasome-dependent mechanism that clears the {ER} of aberrant proteins. Here we review recent studies showing that activated {IP(3)} receptors are ubiquitinated in an unexpectedly complex manner, and that a novel complex composed of the {ER} membrane proteins {SPFH1} and {SPFH2} (erlin 1 and 2) binds to {IP(3)} receptors immediately after they are activated and mediates their {ERAD.} Remarkably, it seems that the conformational changes that underpin channel opening make {IP(3)} receptors resemble aberrant proteins, which triggers their binding to the {SPFH1/2} complex, their ubiquitination and extraction from the {ER} membrane and finally, their degradation by the proteasome. This degradation of activated {IP(3)} receptors by the {ERAD} pathway serves to reduce the sensitivity of {ER} Ca(2+) stores to {IP(3)} and may protect cells against deleterious effects of over-activation of Ca(2+) signaling pathways.},

Here we investigate the requirements for structure and delivery of the interfering {RNA.} To our surprise, we found that double-stranded {RNA} was substantially more effective at producing interference than was either strand individually. After injection into adult animals, purified single strands had at most a modest effect, whereas double-stranded mixtures caused potent and specific interference. The effects of this interference were evident in both the injected animals and their progeny. Only a few molecules of injected double-stranded {RNA} were required per affected cell, arguing against stochiometric interference with endogenous {mRNA} and suggesting that there could be a catalytic or amplification component in the interference process.},

Consequently, the role of an information professional has evolved to include the activities of data curation. This new field more specifically addresses the needs of stewarding and preserving digital research data. In this article, the authors offer an overview of data curation research and education in the field of library and information science, focusing specifically on the current state of professional practice, trends in education and workforce development, and future directions for both basic and applied research. Drawing on the proceedings from two data curation summits held in late 2010, the authors highlight and build on the major insights and recommendations that emerged from discussions among more than 50 leading experts from government agencies, data centers, the field of library and information science, and the publishing industry. Specifically, they note the importance of developing interoperable standards for describing datasets, the need for curators to participate in data privacy and ownership policy development, the demand for a workforce to support discipline-specific data practices, and the varied approaches for professional education that will be required by a data-driven research agenda in both the sciences and humanities. The authors conclude with an overview of future directions for research and workforce development in data curation.},

	abstract = {Escherichia coli {FtsH} ({HflB)} is a membrane-bound and {ATP-dependent} zinc-metalloproteinase, which forms a complex with a pair of periplasmically exposed membrane proteins, {HflK} and {HflC.} It is the protease that degrades uncomplexed forms of the {SecY} subunit of protein translocase. Here, we characterized a new class of {SecY-stabilizing} mutation on the E. coli chromosome. The mutation ({yccA11)} is an internal deletion within a gene ({yccA)} known as an open reading frame for a hydrophobic protein with putative seven transmembrane segments. The {YccA} protein was found to be degraded in an {FtsH-dependent} manner in vivo and in vitro, whereas the {YccA11} mutant protein, lacking eight amino acid residues within the amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain, was refractory to the degradation. The {yccA11} mutation exhibited partial dominance when overexpressed. Cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation, and histidine tagging experiments showed that {YccA11} as well as {YccA} can associate with both the {FtsH} and the {HflKC} proteins. Thus, the mutant {YccA} protein appeared to compete with {SecY} for recognition by the {FtsH} proteolytic system and the residues deleted by the {yccA} mutation are required for the initiation of proteolysis by {FtsH.} Interestingly, the inhibitory action of {YccA11} was mediated by {HflKC}, since the deletion of {hflK-hflC} suppressed the {yccA11} phenotype. The {yccA11} mutation stabilized subunit a of the proton {ATPase} F0 segment as well, but not the {CII} protein of bacteriophage lambda or the sigma 32 protein. From these results we suggest that there are at least two pathways for {FtsH-dependent} protein degradation, only one of which (probably for membrane proteins) is subject to the {HflKC-dependent} interference by the {YccA11} mutant substrate.},

By expressing a myc-tagged stomatin and substituting the three cysteines by serine, individually or in combination, we demonstrate that Cys-29 is the predominant site of palmitoylation and that Cys-86 accounts for the remaining palmitate labeling. Disruption of Cys-52 alone does not show any detectable reduction of palmitic acid incorporation.

Massive and rapidly expanding amounts of data combined with data models that evolve over time contribute to making data management an increasingly challenging task that warrants a new approach. In this paper we present an ontology-centric architecture for data management systems that is extensible and domain independent. In this architecture, the behaviors of domain concepts and objects are captured entirely by ontological entities, around which all data management tasks are carried out. The open and semantic nature of ontology languages also makes this architecture amenable to greater data reuse and interoperability. To evaluate the proposed architecture, we have applied it to the challenge of managing phenomics data.},

	abstract = {How easy is it to reproduce the results found in a typical computational biology paper? Either through experience or intuition the reader will already know that the answer is with difficulty or not at all. In this paper we attempt to quantify this difficulty by reproducing a previously published paper for different classes of users (ranging from users with little expertise to domain experts) and suggest ways in which the situation might be improved. Quantification is achieved by estimating the time required to reproduce each of the steps in the method described in the original paper and make them part of an explicit workflow that reproduces the original results. Reproducing the method took several months of effort, and required using new versions and new software that posed challenges to reconstructing and validating the results. The quantification leads to “reproducibility maps” that reveal that novice researchers would only be able to reproduce a few of the steps in the method, and that only expert researchers with advance knowledge of the domain would be able to reproduce the method in its entirety. The workflow itself is published as an online resource together with supporting software and data. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the complexities of requiring reproducibility in terms of cost versus benefit, and a desiderata with our observations and guidelines for improving reproducibility. This has implications not only in reproducing the work of others from published papers, but reproducing work from one’s own laboratory.},

We report here the molecular characterization of the lin-15 locus. The two lin-15 activities are encoded by contiguous genomic regions and by two distinct, non-overlapping transcripts that may be processed from a single {mRNA} precursor by trans-splicing. Based on the {DNA} sequence, the 719- and 1,440-amino acid lin-15 proteins are not similar to each other or to known proteins. lin-15 multivulva mutants, which are defective in both lin-15 activities, contain deletions and insertions that affect the lin-15 genomic region.},

	abstract = {Executive summary
Our study found widespread support for the implementation of researcher identifiers
in the {UK} and strong but not
unanimous support for {ORCID} as the most suitable
candidate for achieving this.
There are some compelling reasons why a researcher identifier is appropriate at this
time. For most (not all) researchers, there is a reasonable chance of drawing a
boundary aro
und their scholarly work and involvements and an understanding that
there is a benefit in allowing researchers to choose to make certain elements of that
information more publicly available
We illustrate some misunderstandings and misconceptions which {ORCI}
D and those
recommending {UK} wide implementation will need to address through clear public
outreach.
Any researcher identifier will require a compelling demonstration of use case and
interface, {ORCID} will need to demonstrate to individual researchers its po
wer and
potential and the benefits it can bring to them.
Publicity should be given, in particular to the minimum data required and the control
which the researcher will have over the privacy of each associated element. {ORCID}
will need to make it clear that
the {ID} is a tool which in itself does not confer status .
We would welcome a clear statement on interoperability with {ISNI} but we do not
consider that complete merger is a prerequisite.
We recognise the need to “seed” the {ORCID} database and in this contex
t we
recommend that, at least in the short term, the Names project should receive
sufficient funding to share not only their data but also their expertise and experience.
There may be a medium term role in cleaning {UK} data before bulk uploads.
We include
a risk register with 2
1
mitigating actions for consideration.
In the light of the Task and Finish group’s stated desire for a contingency plan, we
recommend that {JISC} encourage the experimental use of {UUIDs} as an underlying
layer as suggested by {CASRAI.}},

We present the sequence of the Cc gene and corresponding {cDNA.} The Cc message contains several open reading frames 5' to the large open reading frame responsible for the lethal complementation group, suggesting that expression of Cc function may be regulated translationally.

	abstract = {Background
Editorial peer review is universally used but little studied. We examined the relationship between external reviewers' recommendations and the editorial outcome of manuscripts undergoing external peer-review at the Journal of General Internal Medicine ({JGIM).}

{Methodology/Principal} Findings
We examined reviewer recommendations and editors' decisions at {JGIM} between 2004 and 2008. For manuscripts undergoing peer review, we calculated chance-corrected agreement among reviewers on recommendations to reject versus accept or revise. Using mixed effects logistic regression models, we estimated intra-class correlation coefficients ({ICC)} at the reviewer and manuscript level. Finally, we examined the probability of rejection in relation to reviewer agreement and disagreement. The 2264 manuscripts sent for external review during the study period received 5881 reviews provided by 2916 reviewers; 28\% of reviews recommended rejection. Chance corrected agreement (kappa statistic) on rejection among reviewers was 0.11 (p{\textless}.01). In mixed effects models adjusting for study year and manuscript type, the reviewer-level {ICC} was 0.23 (95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 0.19–0.29) and the manuscript-level {ICC} was 0.17 (95\% {CI}, 0.12–0.22). The editors' overall rejection rate was 48\%: 88\% when all reviewers for a manuscript agreed on rejection (7\% of manuscripts) and 20\% when all reviewers agreed that the manuscript should not be rejected (48\% of manuscripts) (p{\textless}0.01).

{Conclusions/Significance}
Reviewers at {JGIM} agreed on recommendations to reject vs. accept/revise at levels barely beyond chance, yet editors placed considerable weight on reviewers' recommendations. Efforts are needed to improve the reliability of the peer-review process while helping editors understand the limitations of reviewers' recommendations.},

	abstract = {The red fox, a widely distributed Holarctic carnivore, exhibits a temperature- and latitude-correlated size gradient in the Palaearctic region, but little change of size in the southern part of its range, in the Saharo-Arabian region, where it is sympatric with a smaller congener, Ruppell's sand fox. The slope of the regression of red fox lower carnassial length against mean ambient temperature in the Saharo-Arabian region is very slight, and differs significantly from the slope in the allopatric zone. This deviation suggests ecological character displacement in the red fox in sympatry with its smaller congener. This hypothesis is enhanced by the existence of constant size ratios (1.18-1.21) between lower carnassial lengths of these two foxes throughout the Saharo-Arabian region, notwithstanding regional fluctuations in overall size. Moreover, in Israel, where the still smaller Blanford's fox exists, the ratios between the means for both lower carnassial length and condylo-basal length of the three sympatric species are remarkably constant. Condylo-basal length and canine diameter ratios between the red fox and Ruppell's sand fox in the different localities studied, while displaying the same general pattern, are considerably less regular than ratios of lower carnassial lengths. We suggest that the length of the carnassials relates directly to the feeding habits of these species, and is therefore the suitable morphological character to use when studying ecological character displacement in this group. The length and shape of the skull is influenced by other functions, as well as by autecological factors. Correlating the size of the red fox with various latitude correlated variables (e.g., ambient temperature) should be accompanied by investigation of its size relationship with congeners.},

With long-established citation-based metrics unable to capture the increasing variety of online references to a scholar's work, alternative indicators offer a different view of the influence of that work. Contributed papers demonstrate how altmetrics can work on a personal level to enhance a scholar's {CV} and on a broad, even global level, to transform scholarly communication through its interaction with open access, digital repositories and research in emerging countries. One article suggests altmetrics should soon be included among mainstream metrics, and other contributions describe specific indicators and altmetric software considerations. The need for innovative measurement and the advantages of altmetrics in particular bode well for their wide acceptance and continuing development.},

The successful use of these data to achieve new scientific breakthroughs will depend on the ability to access, integrate, and analyze these large datasets. Robust data organization and publication methods are needed within the research community to enable data discovery and scientific analysis by researchers other than those that collected the data. We present a new method for publishing research datasets consisting of point observations that employs a standard observations data model populated using controlled vocabularies for environmental and water resources data along with web services for transmitting data to consumers. We describe how these components have reduced the syntactic and semantic heterogeneity in the data assembled within a national network of environmental observatory test beds and how this data publication system has been used to create a federated network of consistent research data out of a set of geographically decentralized and autonomous test bed databases.},

	abstract = {Slender-tailed meerkats (Suricata suricatta) are small, diurnal, and gregarious mongooses which inhabit the semi-arid regions of southern Africa. In the south-western Kalahari, substantial fluctuations in productivity are caused by extreme seasonality in rainfall and temperatures. We observed the foraging behaviour of habituated meerkats from January to July, a period covering the entire birth season and stages of high and low prey availability. Insects were the most frequently occurring prey class (78.1\%), of which larvae (33.4\% total frequency) and adult Coleoptera (27.5\% total frequency) were the most important prey items throughout the year. Reptiles were heavily utilized in terms of prey bulk-an index of volume-(19.9\%), but not by frequency (9.2\%). Consumption of Coleoptera was positively correlated with rainfall, and negatively with temperature. Meerkats used a mean of 6.7 ± 1.1 prey categories daily, and there were significant monthly differences in prey diversity in the diet. Dietary shifts were apparently related to fluctuations in prey availability and the presence of preferred prey. There were no differences between the sexes in dietary diversity or niche breadth, but pregnant and lactating females foraged at significantly higher rates than males. The timing of foraging activity altered over the months in response to changes in daylength and thermoregulatory constraints. Foraging behaviour and seasonality in foraging effort are described, and the implications of an insect prey base for meerkat socioecology are discussed.},

A key question is whether analogous molecular complexes in higher organisms transduce mechanical signals. To address this question, we selected mechanoreceptors of the rat vibrissal follicle-sinus complex in the mystacial pad and the trigeminal ganglia for an immunocytochemical and molecular biological study. {RT-PCR} of poly(A+) {mRNA} of rat trigeminal ganglia indicated that alpha-, beta-, and gamma-{ENaC} and stomatin {mRNA} are expressed in rat trigeminal ganglia. Using immunocytochemistry, we found that alpha-, beta-, and gamma-{ENaC} subunits and stomatin are localized in the perikarya of the trigeminal neurons and in a minor fraction of their termination site in the vibrissal follicle-sinus complex, where longitudinal lanceolate endings are immunopositive. We conclude that alpha-, beta-, and gamma-{ENaC} subunits as well as the candidate interacting protein stomatin are coexpressed in a mammalian mechanoreceptor, a location consistent with a possible role in mechanotransduction.},

Sloth bears were once   very common throughout the Indian Peninsula (Brander 1982). During the   1940s and 1950s, many naturalists noticed a sharp decline in sloth bear   sightings in the wild, as well as of dancing bears on the streets (Photo   2.4.1) (Seshadri 1969; Krishnan 1972; Singh 1973). This decline was   related to loss of forests, and degradation and fragmentation of   habitats. At present, the population within protected areas is   comparatively stable, whereas the population outside protected areas is   declining. This decline is mainly because of increasing threats by human   activities. Thus, this species is designated as an endangered species},

Sounds, movements, feeding, grooming,   threatening, defence and playing and the behavior of the mother are   described. The bodily development of the young was also studied. Voices,   sleeping positions, scraping, stretching, threatening, and defence   reactions are similar to those of other Viverridae and especially   species of the same subfamily of Herpestinae. For comparing the behavior   of Suricata with that of other Camivora, several components are found   corresponding to those of Mustelidae]. Although that family seems not to   be related taxonomically to Suricata some behavior components seem to be   homologous and not just analogous. During a short period of their   development only young Suricata cover the pit for their excrements and   later on they only scratch out such a pit but do not cover it, after   deposing their excrements. This suggests that the juvenile behavior   trait might be vestigial. {\textbar}{\textbar} {ABSTRACT} {AUTHORS:} Author},

The vectors contain the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (beta Gal)-encoding region (the {lacZ} gene) flanked by unique polylinker segments on the 5' and 3' ends, and several combinations of a variety of modules: a selectable marker (an amber suppressor {tRNA)}, a translational initiation region, a synthetic intron segment, the early polyadenylation signal from {SV40}, and 3' regions from two nematode genes. A segment encoding the nuclear localization peptide from the {SV40} T antigen is incorporated into many of the constructs, leading to beta Gal accumulation in nuclei, which can facilitate identification of producing cells in complex tissues. To make functional beta Gal fusions to secreted proteins, we constructed plasmids with an alternate module encoding a synthetic transmembrane domain upstream from {lacZ.} This domain is designed to stop transfer of secreted proteins across the membrane during secretion, allowing the beta Gal domain of the fusion polypeptide to remain in the cytoplasm and thus function in enzymatic assays. We have used the vectors to analyze expression of several genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and have demonstrated in these studies that {lacZ} can be expressed in a wide variety of different tissues and cell types. These vectors should be useful in studying gene expression both in C. elegans and in other experimental systems.},

To investigate the extent to which predation rate affects survival, we compared mortality rates in two populations of suricates (Suricata suricatta), one living in an area of high predator density (Kalahari Gemsbok Park) and one living in an area of relatively low predator density (neighbouring ranchland). Most aspects of feeding ecology and growth (including time spent feeding, daily weight gain, growth, adult body weight, breeding frequency and neonatal mortality) were similar in the two populations. In contrast, mortality of animals over 3 months old was 1·7 times higher in the Park than on ranchland.3. Mortality of juveniles between emergence from the natal burrow and 6 months of age was higher in small groups than large ones in the Park but significantly lower in small groups than large ones on ranchland. Adult mortality declined in larger groups in both areas.4. The tendency for survival to be low in small groups had far-reaching consequences for the risk of group extinction. During a year of low rainfall in the Park, all groups of less than nine animals became extinct and population density declined to around a third of its initial level. We argue that high group extinction rates are to be expected in species where survival declines in small groups and mortality rates are high.},

Nine independent suppressor mutations were judged to lie in a single suppressor gene, sup-3. Suppression is dominant, but dose dependent, and results in improved locomotion, as well as in an increase in the ability of mutant animals to lay eggs. Mutations in six genes known to affect muscle structure were tested for suppression by representative sup-3 mutations. Alleles of three of the six genes are suppressed, two of which are known to code for thick filament proteins. One suppressor allele was identified as a deletion by genetic criteria. A second case of indirect suppression is not associated with muscle defects, but involves two mutant genes producing uncoordinated phenotypes very similar to one another. As in the first case, suppression is dominant but dose dependent and is not allele specific.},

The area has 2 broad forest types - subtropical hill forests and tropical moist deciduous forests - and is rich in wildlife with {\textgreater}21 species of large mammals recorded. The most common species are the Indian gaur (Bos gaurus), sambars (Cervus unicolor), chitals (Axis [Cervus] axis), barking deer (Muntiacus muntjak), four horned antelopes (Tetraceros quadricornis) and sloth bears (Melursus ursinus). Elephants are absent and carnivores include tigers (Panthera tigris), panthers (Panthera pardus), hyenas (Hyaena hyaena) and jackals (Canis alpinus). Sex-ratios (male to female) of sambars and spotted deer were 1:5 and 1:2, respectively. Herbivores preferred grasslands and bamboo forests to teak [Tectona grandis] plantations, and no significant difference was found in habitat use between grasslands and bamboo forests. Herbivores showed no significant difference in habitat use between Lantana-infested forests and forests in which Lantana had been eradicated. Herbivores preferred young teak plantations to sal [Shorea robusta] forests. Complete bark damage of teak poles by sambar was found on only 2.5\% of trees; these trees showed a reduction in diameter at breast height.},

The article begins by saying the {DOI} is a name, not a location. Though the {DOI} can and is used to locate a resource, the {DOI} is a specific identifier for a resource. The {DOI} Foundation provides a {DOI} resolution service so that if a person knows the {DOI} of a resource, he or she can find it easily.
The structure of the {DOI} is similar to that of the {ARK.} It begins with the {“DOI} prefix” which identifies the naming authority. After the prefix, there is the {“DOI} suffix” which is the actual identifier. The {DOI} accommodates any type of identifier, even an {ISBN} or {ISSN.}
Resolution of the {DOI} happens on the resolution server, which is based on the Handle System. Once the requester sends the requested {DOI} to the Handle System, the Handle System determines which type of information is requested, then sends it back to the requester in whatever form is appropriate, such as metadata, video, or a data set.
The remainder of the article discusses the {DOI} Data Model, which consists of a data dictionary and a frameworks for applying it, and discusses how the {DOI} is implemented. It goes on to describe two projects that have implemented the {DOI} system: the German National Library of Science and Technology’s project assigning {DOIs} to primary research data, and the Names for Life Project, which is a project that assigned {DOIs} to taxonomic data.
One disadvantages of the {DOI} is that it there is cost for an organization to assign one. In today’s world of decreasing library and data center budgets, this is a strong incentive to using an {ARK} over a {DOI}, due to the costs of assigning a {DOI}, but the {DOI} has the advantage of being a more widely used standard.-Christopher Eaker}

	abstract = {Mosquito sterol carrier protein-2 ({AeSCP-2)} and sterol carrier protein-2-like2 ({AeSCP-2L2)} are members of the {SCP-2} protein family with similar expression profiles in the mosquito life cycle. In an effort to understand how lipids can be transported by different {SCP-2} proteins, the three-dimensional crystal structure of {AeSCP-2L2} was solved at 1.7 A resolution. {AeSCP-2L2} forms a dimer and binds three fatty acids, one of which resides in a position within the internal cavity at a right angle to the others. This first report of ligand-bound dimerized protein in the {SCP-2} protein family indicates that the family has a much more divergent mode of interaction with ligands than previously reported. The potential function of {AeSCP-2L2} was investigated via in vivo incorporation of [({3)H]cholesterol} and [{3H]palmitic} acid. Overexpression of {AeSCP-2L2} in mosquito cells leads to an increased uptake of free fatty acid, whereas knockdown of {AeSCP-2L2} in adult females decreases the accumulation of free fatty acid in the fat body from a blood meal. In contrast, overexpression or knockdown of {AeSCP-2L2} has no effect on cholesterol uptake. Our results suggest that the main function of {AeSCP-2L2} is as a general intracellular fatty acid carrier, as opposed to having a dedicated role in cholesterol transport.},

	abstract = {The action of nuclear hormone receptors is tripartite, involving the receptor, its ligands, and its coregulator proteins. The estrogen receptor ({ER)}, a member of this superfamily, is a hormone-activated transcription factor that mediates the stimulatory effects of estrogens and the inhibitory effects of antiestrogens such as tamoxifen in breast cancer and other estrogen target cells. To understand how antiestrogens and dominant negative {ERs} suppress {ER} activity, we used a dominant negative {ER} as bait in two-hybrid screening assays from which we isolated a clone from breast cancer cells that potentiates the inhibitory activities of dominant negative {ERs} and antiestrogen-liganded {ER.} At higher concentrations, it also represses the transcriptional activity of the estradiol-liganded {ER}, while having no effect on other nuclear hormone receptors. This clone, denoted {REA} for "repressor of estrogen receptor activity," encodes a 37-{kDa} protein that is an {ER-selective} coregulator. Its competitive reversal of steroid receptor coactivator 1 enhancement of {ER} activity and its direct interaction with liganded {ER} suggest that it may play an important role in determining the sensitivity of estrogen target cells, including breast cancer cells, to antiestrogens and estrogens.},

Here, we strive to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive inventory of the potential implications of personality differences, ranging from population growth and persistence to species interactions and community dynamics, and covering issues such as social evolution, the speed of evolution, evolvability, and speciation. The emerging picture strongly suggests that personality differences matter for ecological and evolutionary processes (and their interaction) and, thus, should be considered a key dimension of ecologically and evolutionarily relevant intraspecific variation.},

	abstract = {Invertebrates, tetrapod vertebrates, and fish might be expected to differ in their number of gene copies, possibly due the occurrence of genome duplication events during animal evolution. Reggie (flotillin) genes code for membrane-associated proteins involved in growth signaling in developing and regenerating axons. Until now, there appeared to be only two reggie genes in fruitflies, mammals, and fish. The aim of this research was to search for additional copies of reggie genes in fishes, since a genome duplication might have increased the gene copy number in this group. We report the presence of up to four distinct reggie genes (two reggie-1 and two reggie-2 genes) in the genomes of zebrafish and goldfish. Phylogenetic analyses show that the zebrafish and goldfish sequence pairs are orthologous, and that the additional copies could have arisen through a genome duplication in a common ancestor of bony fish. The presence of novel reggie {mRNAs} in fish embryos indicates that the newly discovered gene copies are transcribed and possibly expressed in the developing and regenerating nervous system. The intron/exon boundaries of the new fish genes characterized here correspond with those of human genes, both in location and phase. An evolutionary scenario for the evolution of reggie intron-exon structure, where loss of introns appears to be a distinctive trait in invertebrate reggie genes, is presented.},

Yet almost a decade after their discovery, the function of reggies/ flotillins is still enigmatic. In this review we summarize the present state of knowledge on reggie/flotillin structure, localization and function, and discuss the role of the proteins in development and disease. Based on insights into reggie/flotillin function and by comparison with related proteins of the so-called {SPFH} ({Stomatin/Prohibitin/Flotillin/HflK/C)} protein family, including stomatin, podocin and prohibitin, we propose the existence of specific types of protein-defined microdomains which are sculpt by the clustering of individual {SPFH} proteins. As 'specialized rafts' similar to caveolae, these membrane domains provide platforms for the recruitment of multiprotein complexes. Since, under certain circumstances, reggie-2/flotillin-1 translocates to the nucleus, reggie/ flotillin microdomains are not only stable scaffolds but also dynamic units with their own regulatory functions.},

	abstract = {Many initiatives encourage research investigators to share their raw research datasets in hopes of increasing research efficiency and quality. Despite these investments of time and money, we do not have a firm grasp on the prevalence or patterns of data sharing and reuse. Previous survey methods for understanding data sharing patterns provide insight into investigator attitudes, but do not facilitate direct measurement of data sharing behaviour or its correlates. In this study, we evaluate and use bibliometric methods to understand the impact, prevalence, and patterns with which investigators publicly share their raw gene expression microarray datasets after study {publication.To} begin, we analyzed the citation history of 85 clinical trials published between 1999 and 2003. Almost half of the trials had shared their microarray data publicly on the internet. Publicly available data was significantly (p=0.006) associated with a 69\% increase in citations, independently of journal impact factor, date of publication, and author country of {origin.Digging} deeper into data sharing patterns required methods for automatically identifying data creation and data sharing. We derived a full-text query to identify studies that generated gene expression microarray data. Issuing the query in {PubMed} Central, Highwire Press, and Google Scholar found 56\% of the data-creation studies in our gold standard, with 90\% precision. Next, we established that searching {ArrayExpress} and the Gene Expression Omnibus databases for {PubMed} article identifiers retrieved 77\% of associated publicly-accessible {datasets.We} used these methods to identify 11603 publications that created gene expression microarray data. Authors of at least 25\% of these publications deposited their data in the predominant public databases. We collected a wide set of variables about these studies and derived 15 factors that describe their authorship, funding, institution, publication, and domain environments. In second-order analysis, authors with a history of sharing and reusing shared gene expression microarray data were most likely to share their data, and those studying human subjects and cancer were least likely to {share.We} hope these methods and results will contribute to a deeper understanding of data sharing behavior and eventually more effective data sharing initiatives.},

The workshop {"Bridging} Data Lifecycles: Tracking Data Use via Data Citations," held by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ({UCAR)} in April, 2012, brought together 80 people from 30+ organizations to discuss many aspects of data citations. This report outlines the important activities, tools, challenges, and impediments to data citation initiatives that were identified during the workshop. The report also outlines a set of recommendations on how to get started on the processes of assigning citations and actionable identifiers to data sets without having solved every issue. By making it easy for users, providing openness and transparency in how data citation tools are being applied, and leveraging the interest and expertise of the multiple communities of stakeholders, organizations can promote, enable, and embed data citations as regular components of the scholarly communication infrastructure.},

	abstract = {Although originally identified as putative negative regulators of the cell cycle, recent studies have demonstrated that the {PHB} proteins act as a chaperone in the assembly of subunits of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. The two {PHB} proteins, Phblp and Phb2p, are located in the mitochondrial inner membrane where they form a large complex that represents a novel type of membrane-bound chaperone. On the basis of its native molecular weight, the {PHB-complex} should contain 12-14 copies of both Phblp and Phb2p. The {PHB} complex binds directly to newly synthesised mitochondrial translation products and stabilises them against degradation by membrane-bound metalloproteases belonging to the family of mitochondrial triple-A proteins. Sequence homology assigns Phb1p and Phb2p to a family of proteins which also contains stomatins, {HflKC}, flotillins and plant defence proteins. However, to date only the bacterial {HflKC} proteins have been shown to possess a direct functional homology with the {PHB} complex. Previously assigned actions of the {PHB} proteins, including roles in tumour suppression, cell cycle regulation, immunoglobulin M receptor binding and apoptosis seem unlikely in view of any hard evidence in their support. Nevertheless, because the proteins are probably indirectly involved in ageing and cancer, we assess their possible role in these processes. Finally, we suggest that the original name for these proteins, the prohibitins, should be amended to reflect their roles as proteins that hold badly formed subunits, thereby keeping the nomenclature already in use but altering its meaning to reflect their true function more accurately.},

Background
Our study purpose was to assess the predictive validity of reviewer quality ratings and editorial decisions in a general medicine journal.


Methods
Submissions to the Journal of General Internal Medicine ({JGIM)} between July 2004 and June 2005 were included. We abstracted {JGIM} peer review quality ratings, verified the publication status of all articles and calculated an impact factor for published articles (Rw) by dividing the 3-year citation rate by the average for this group of papers; an Rw{\textgreater}1 indicates a greater than average impact.


Results
Of 507 submissions, 128 (25\%) were published in {JGIM}, 331 rejected (128 with review) and 48 were either not resubmitted after revision was requested or were withdrawn by the author. Of 331 rejections, 243 were published elsewhere. Articles published in {JGIM} had a higher citation rate than those published elsewhere (Rw: 1.6 vs. 1.1, p = 0.002). Reviewer quality ratings of article quality had good internal consistency and reviewer recommendations markedly influenced publication decisions. There was no quality rating cutpoint that accurately distinguished high from low impact articles. There was a stepwise increase in Rw for articles rejected without review, rejected after review or accepted by {JGIM} (Rw 0.60 vs. 0.87 vs. 1.56, p{\textless}0.0005). However, there was low agreement between reviewers for quality ratings and publication recommendations. The editorial publication decision accurately discriminated high and low impact articles in 68\% of submissions. We found evidence of better accuracy with a greater number of reviewers.


Conclusions
The peer review process largely succeeds in selecting high impact articles and dispatching lower impact ones, but the process is far from perfect. While the inter-rater reliability between individual reviewers is low, the accuracy of sorting is improved with a greater number of reviewers.},

These cells are the touch receptors, which mediate the response to gentle touch, and the {FLP} and {PVD} neurons. {PVD} mediates a response to harsh mechanical stimuli, and {FLP} has an ultrastructure suggestive of a mechanoreceptor, but its function is unknown. mec-3 is necessary for the differentiation of the touch receptors, because in mec-3 mutants, the touch receptors do not function and have none of their distinguishing features. mec-3 is also needed for {PVD} function: The {PVD} neurons no longer mediate a response to harsh mechanical stimuli in the mutants. The expression of the mec-3-{lacZ} fusion, and presumably mec-3 itself, is altered by mutations in several genes originally identified by their effects on touch cell development. unc-86, another homeo-box-containing gene, is necessary for all mec-3-{lacZ} expression, but also affects several other lineages and cells in which mec-3 is not expressed. mec-3 activity appears to be required for maintained expression of the mec-3-{lacZ} fusion in all cells in which it is expressed. In a mec-17 mutant, mec-3-{lacZ} expression is not maintained in the touch receptors, but is not affected in the {FLP} and {PVD} neurons. These findings suggest that combinatorial mechanisms of gene regulation control both the expression of mec-3 itself and its action in promoting the terminal differentiation of various cell types.},

Publishers of such data must satisfy the integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation requirements of clients. Providing this protection over public networks is costly. This is partly because building and running secure systems is hard. In practice, large systems can not be verified to be secure and are frequently penetrated. The consequences of a system intrusion at the data publisher can be severe. This is further complicated by data and server replication to satisfy availability and scalability requirements. We aim to reduce the trust required of the publisher of large, infrequently updated databases. To do this, we separate the roles of owner and publisher. With a few trusted digital signatures from the owner, an untrusted publisher can use techniques based on Merkle hash trees to provide authenticity and non-repudiation of the answer to a database query. We do not require a key to be held in an on-line system, thus reducing the impact of system penetrations. By allowing untrusted publishers, we also allow more scalable publication of large databases.},

	abstract = {If the 1990s was all about the information superhighway and the network society, then the first 10 years of the 21st century is perhaps best described as the decade of data. Actors in different enterprises worked feverishly to develop innovative database and data mining technologies for institutional goals such as marketing, social networking, and scientific discovery. These researchers and data entrepreneurs follow an emerging belief that gathering and mining massive amounts of digital data will give objective insight into human relations and provide authentic representations for decision-making. On the surface, the technologies used to mine big data have the appearance of value-free and neutral inquiry. However, as information entrepreneurs use database and data mining technologies to purposively organize the social world, this seeming neutrality obfuscates domain assumptions and leaves cultural values and practices of power unexamined. We investigate the role of communication and social shaping of database and data mining technologies in the institutional context of genome science to understand how various stakeholders (scientists, policy makers, social scientists, and advocates) articulate racialized meanings with biological, physical, and big data. We found a rise in the use of racial discourse that suggests race has a genetic foundation.},

The nematode C. elegans has only fourteen types of chemosensory neurons, but it responds to dozens of chemicals, because each chemosensory neuron detects several stimuli. Here we describe over 40 highly divergent members of the G protein-coupled receptor family that could contribute to this functional diversity. Most of these candidate receptor genes are in clusters of two to nine similar genes. Eleven of fourteen tested genes appear to be expressed in small subsets of chemosensory neurons. A single type of chemosensory neuron can potentially express at least four different receptor genes. Some of these genes might encode receptors for water-soluble attractants, repellents, and pheromones.},

	abstract = {The embryonic cell lineage of Caenorhabditis elegans has been traced from zygote to newly hatched larva, with the result that the entire cell lineage of this organism is now known. During embryogenesis 671 cells are generated; in the hermaphrodite 113 of these (in the male 111) undergo programmed death and the remainder either differentiate terminally or become postembryonic blast cells. The embryonic lineage is highly invariant, as are the fates of the cells to which it gives rise. In spite of the fixed relationship between cell ancestry and cell fate, the correlation between them lacks much obvious pattern. Thus, although most neurons arise from the embryonic ectoderm, some are produced by the mesoderm and a few are sisters to muscles; again, lineal boundaries do not necessarily coincide with functional boundaries. Nevertheless, cell ablation experiments (as well as previous cell isolation experiments) demonstrate substantial cell autonomy in at least some sections of embryogenesis. We conclude that the cell lineage itself, complex as it is, plays an important role in determining cell fate. We discuss the origin of the repeat units (partial segments) in the body wall, the generation of the various orders of symmetry, the analysis of the lineage in terms of sublineages, and evolutionary implications.},

Roles for prohibitins in cell signaling at the plasma membrane and in transcriptional regulation in the nucleus have been proposed, but pleiotropic defects associated with the loss of prohibitin genes can be largely attributed to a dysfunction of mitochondria. Two closely related proteins, prohibitin-1 ({PHB1)} and prohibitin-2 ({PHB2)}, form large, multimeric ring complexes in the inner membrane of mitochondria. The absence of prohibitins leads to an increased generation of reactive oxygen species, disorganized mitochondrial nucleoids, abnormal cristae morphology and an increased sensitivity towards stimuli-elicited apoptosis. It has been found that the processing of the dynamin-like {GTPase} {OPA1}, which regulates mitochondrial fusion and cristae morphogenesis, is a key process regulated by prohibitins. Furthermore, genetic analyses in yeast have revealed an intimate functional link between prohibitin complexes and the membrane phospholipids cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine. In light of these findings, it is emerging that prohibitin complexes can function as protein and lipid scaffolds that ensure the integrity and functionality of the mitochondrial inner membrane.},

Optic nerve injury leads to reexpression of proteins, which typically are first expressed in newly differentiated retinal ganglion cells and axons. Here we identified two new proteins of fish retinal ganglion cells, reggie-1 and reggie-2, with monoclonal antibody M802 and molecular cloning techniques. In normal fish, M802 stained the few retinal axons derived from newborn ganglion cells which in fish are added lifelong to the retinal margin. After optic nerve injury, however, M802 labeled all retinal ganglion cells and retinal axons throughout their path into tectum. Consistent with M802 staining, reggie-1 and reggie-2 {mRNAs} were present in lesioned retinal ganglion cells, as demonstrated by in situ hybridization, but were not detectable in their normal mature counterparts. In western blots with membrane proteins of the adult goldfish brain, M802 recognizes a 48x10(3) Mr protein band. At the amino acid level, 48x10(3) Mr reggie-1 and reggie-2 are 44\% identical, lack transmembrane and membrane anchor domains, but appear membrane associated by ionic interactions. Reggie-1 and reggie-2 are homologous to 35x10(3) Mr {ESA} (human epidermal surface antigen) but are here identified as neuronal surface proteins, present on newly differentiated ganglion cells at the retinal margin and which are reexpressed in mature ganglion cells upon injury and during axonal regeneration.},

Real-time imaging of {NBD-cholesterol} (poorly esterified) and H(3)-cholesterol (extensively esterified) efflux from cultured primary hepatocytes of wild-type and sterol carrier protein-2 ({SCP-2)} gene ablated mice showed: (i) {NBD-cholesterol} efflux was affected by the type of lipoprotein acceptor, i.e. {HDL3} over {HDL2;} (ii) {NBD-cholesterol} efflux was rapid (detected in 1-2 min), and resolved into fast (t(1/2)= 2.4 min, 6\% of total) and slow (t(1/2)= 26.5 min, 94\% of total) pools consistent with protein- and vesicle-mediated cholesterol transfer, respectively; (iii) {SCP-2} gene ablation increased efflux of {NBD-cholesterol} as well as H(3)-cholesterol-albeit less so due to competition by esterification of H(3)-cholesterol but not {NBD-cholesterol;} (iv) {SCP-2} gene ablation increased initial rate (2.3-fold) and size (9.7-fold) of rapid effluxing sterol-suggesting increased contribution of molecular cholesterol transfer. In addition, colocalization, double immunolabeling {FRET} and {EM} as well as cross-linking co-{IP} indicated {SCP-2} directly interacted with the {HDL} receptor, scavenger receptor B1 ({SRB1)} in hepatocytes. Other membrane proteins in cholesterol efflux ({SRB1}, {ABCA-1}, {ABCG-1}, {ABCG-5}, {ABCG-8)} and several soluble/vesicle associated proteins facilitating intracellular cholesterol trafficking ({StARDs}, {NPCs}, {ORPs)} were not upregulated. However, loss of {SCP-2} elicited 2-fold upregulation of L-{FABP-a} protein with lower affinity for cholesterol, but higher cytosolic concentration than {SCP-2.} Ablating both {SCP-2} and L-{FABP} decreased {HDL-mediated} {NBD-cholesterol} efflux. These results indicated that {SCP-2} expression plays a significant role in {HDL-mediated} cholesterol efflux by regulating the size of the rapid vs slow cholesterol efflux pools and/or eliciting concomitant upregulation of L-{FABP} in cultured primary hepatocytes.},

	abstract = {Estimates of abundance based on capturing, marking, and recapturing a small sample of bears are likely to be biased and imprecise, and indices of abundance are of little value if not verified with reliable population estimates. We captured and radiocollared 17 sloth bears (Melursus ursinus) in Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal, but recapture rates were too low to derive a meaningful mark-recapture population estimate. However, we frequently observed these bears while radiotracking them, and in 47 instances saw another bear (not offspring) near the one that we were tracking; we used these sightings of associated bears as our "recapture" sample, thereby providing a means of estimating abundance. We divided estimates of abundance by the area of composite seasonal home ranges to obtain estimates of density. Densities varied by season and habitat (25-72 bears/100 km$^{\textrm{2}}$). We extrapolated density estimates to obtain a population estimate for the entire park (≈250 bears, excluding dependent young). We also evaluated incidence of bear-excavated termite colonies (holes in mounds or in the ground) as a potential index of bear density. This proposed index did not reflect differences in estimated bear density between habitats within the park, probably because of habitat-related differences in bear diets and in the persistence of their diggings. However, incidence of digging reflected apparent differences in bear density for areas with similar habitats. Incidence of bear diggings outside the park, where local people reported low bear densities, was only 10-20\% of that in similar habitat within the park, despite equal densities of termite mounds. No bear diggings were found where local people indicated that bears had been extirpated. Thus, diggings appear to be a means of detecting the presence or absence and relative abundance of sloth bears.},

Thus, expression of unc-86 protein is dependent on cell lineage. unc-86 protein is not asymmetrically segregated at further divisions. unc-86 protein also appears shortly after cell division in the nuclei of particular identified differentiating neurons; at least some of these neurons are nonfunctional in unc-86 mutants.},

At their core is the ciliary axoneme, a microtubule-based structure that defines cilium morphology and provides a substrate for intraflagellar transport. However, the extent to which axonemal microtubules are specialized for sensory cilium function is unknown. In the nematode C. elegans, primary cilia are present at the dendritic ends of most sensory neurons, where they provide a specialized environment for the transduction of particular stimuli. Here, we find that three tubulin isotypes-the alpha-tubulins {TBA-6} and {TBA-9} and the beta-tubulin {TBB-4-are} specifically expressed in overlapping sets of C. elegans sensory neurons and localize to the sensory cilia of these cells. Though cilia still form in mutants lacking tba-6, tba-9 and tbb-4, ciliary function is often compromised: these mutants exhibit a variety of sensory deficits as well as the mislocalization of signaling components. In at least one case, that of the {CEM} sensory neurons, characteristic ciliary architecture is disrupted in mutants lacking specific ciliary tubulins. While there is likely to be some functional redundancy among C. elegans tubulin genes, our results indicate that specific tubulins optimize the functional properties of C. elegans sensory cilia.},

Newmeyer In a previous genetic screen for C. elegans mutants that survive in the presence of an antimitotic drug, hemiasterlin, we identified 8 strong mutants. Two of these were found to be resistant to multiple toxins, and in one of these we identified a missense mutation in phb-2, which encodes the mitochondrial protein prohibitin 2. Here we identify two additional mutations that confer drug resistance, spg-7 and har-1, also in genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Other mitochondrial mutants, isp-1, eat-3 and clk-1, were also found to be drug-resistant. Respiratory complex inhibitors, {FCCP} and oligomycin, and a producer of reactive oxygen species ({ROS)}, paraquat, all rescued wild type worms from hemiasterlin toxicity. Worms lacking mitochondrial superoxide dismutase were modestly drug-resistant, and elimination of {MnSOD} in the phb-2, har-1 and spg-7 mutants enhanced resistance. The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine prevented mitochondrial inhibitors from rescuing wild type worms from hemiasterlin and sensitized mutants to the toxin, suggesting that a mechanism sensitive to {ROS} is necessary to trigger drug resistance in C. elegans. Using genetics, we show that this drug resistance requires pkc-1, the C. elegans ortholog of human {PKCepsilon.}},

The elaborate retrieval mechanisms that support such access are a product of technology. But technology is not enough. The effectiveness of a system for accessing information is a direct function of the intelligence put into organizing it. Just as the practical field of engineering has theoretical physics as its underlying base, the design of systems for organizing information rests on an intellectual foundation. The subject of this book is the systematized body of knowledge that constitutes this foundation. Integrating the disparate disciplines of descriptive cataloging, subject cataloging, indexing, and classification, the book adopts a conceptual framework that views the process of organizing information as the use of a special language of description called a bibliographic language. The book is divided into two parts. The first part is an analytic discussion of the intellectual foundation of information organization. The second part moves from generalities to particulars, presenting an overview of three bibliographic languages: work languages, document languages, and subject languages. It looks at these languages in terms of their vocabulary, semantics, and syntax. The book is written in an exceptionally clear style, at a level that makes it understandable to those outside the discipline of library and information science.

Rather, it appears their constituents have evolved intrinsic characteristics that make homogeneous distribution of components unlikely. As a case in point, the concept of lipid rafts has received considerable attention from biologists and biophysicists since the formalization of the hypothesis more than 10 years ago. Today, it is clear that sphingolipid and cholesterol can self-associate into micron-scaled phases in model membranes and that these lipids are involved in the formation of highly dynamic nanoscale heterogeneity in the plasma membrane of living cells. However, it remains unclear whether these entities are manifestations of the same principle. A powerful means by which the molecular organization of rafts can be assessed is through analysis of their functionalized condition. Raft heterogeneity can be activated to coalesce and laterally reorganize/stabilize bioactivity in cell membranes. Evaluation of this property suggests that functional raft heterogeneity arises through principles of lipid-driven phase segregation coupled to additional chemical specificities, probably involving proteins.},

	abstract = {Background

The widespread reluctance to share published research data is often hypothesized to be due to the authors' fear that reanalysis may expose errors in their work or may produce conclusions that contradict their own. However, these hypotheses have not previously been studied systematically.

Methods and Findings

We related the reluctance to share research data for reanalysis to 1148 statistically significant results reported in 49 papers published in two major psychology journals. We found the reluctance to share data to be associated with weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect) and a higher prevalence of apparent errors in the reporting of statistical results. The unwillingness to share data was particularly clear when reporting errors had a bearing on statistical significance.

Conclusions

Our findings on the basis of psychological papers suggest that statistical results are particularly hard to verify when reanalysis is more likely to lead to contrasting conclusions. This highlights the importance of establishing mandatory data archiving policies},

To determine the frequency and clinical significance of {NRG1} aberrations in clinical breast tumors, a breast cancer tissue microarray was screened for {NRG1} aberrations by fluorescent in situ hybridization ({FISH)} using a two-color split-apart probe combination flanking the {NRG1} gene. Rearrangements of {NRG1} were identified in 17/382 cases by {FISH}, and bacterial artificial chromosome array comparative genomic hybridization was applied to five of these cases to further map the chromosome 8p abnormalities. In all five cases, there was a novel amplicon centromeric to {NRG1} with a minimum common region of amplification encompassing two genes, {SPFH2} and {FLJ14299.} Subsequent {FISH} analysis for the novel amplicon revealed that it was present in 63/262 cases. Abnormalities of {NRG1} did not correlate with patient outcome, but the novel amplicon was associated with poor prognosis in univariate analysis, and in multivariate analysis was of prognostic significance independent of nodal status, tumor grade, estrogen receptor status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor ({HER)2} overexpression. Of the two genes in the novel amplicon, expression of {SPFH2} correlated most significantly with amplification. This amplicon may emerge as a result of breakpoints and chromosomal rearrangements within the {NRG1} locus.},

The protein is thought to be anchored to the membrane by a hydrophobic domain while both N and C termini are exposed to the cytoplasm. We have previously shown in the human cell line {UAC} that stomatin concentrates preferentially in plasma membrane folds and protrusions. There is also evidence that stomatin is linked to the cortical actin cytoskeleton, suggesting a role in cortical morphogenesis of the cell. In this study, we demonstrate that the fundamental structure of stomatin is oligomeric. Whereas interaction of stomatin with itself was suggested by cross-linking experiments, we show by density gradient centrifugation analysis that soluble homo-oligomeric complexes of this protein are present in Triton X-100 extracts of {UAC} cells. We also show the existence of these oligomers by co-immunoprecipitation of the endogenous stomatin and a recombinantly expressed myc-tagged stomatin, using an anti-myc antibody. The data indicate that these complexes comprise between 9 and 12 monomers of stomatin. Two C-terminally truncated forms of stomatin do not incorporate into these oligomers, suggesting an involvement of the C terminus in the homo-oligomeric interaction.},

The yeast prohibitins, Phb1p and Phb2p, are close in sequence to their two human counterparts, prohibitin and {BAP37.} Mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that lack these prohibitins have a shortened replicative (budding) life span. Nevertheless, their chronological life span, measured as the survival of stationary phase (G0) cells over time, is essentially normal. Loss of prohibitins does not hypersensitise cells to their endogenous free radical production, though it does slightly increase their sensitivity to ethanol. It is unlikely, therefore, that the influences of prohibitins over replicative senescence involve free radicals, despite the evidence from many systems linking ageing to the long-term effects of oxidative stress. Yeast phb1 and phb2 mutants and also the phb1, phb2 double mutant, tend to lose respiration competence when in G0-arrest, indicating that nondividing cells lacking prohibitins have problems maintaining a functional mitochondrial electron transport chain. This may reflect an imbalance in the turnover of components of the respiratory chain in G0 cells, since the Phb1/2p complex is known to help stabilise these components. Such losses of respiratory function in G0-arrested cells are greater with the loss of Phb1p than with the loss of Phb2p, revealing the Phb1p null and Phb2p null phenotypes to be nonidentical.},

	abstract = {Mutations of {NPHS1} or {NPHS2}, the genes encoding for the glomerular podocyte proteins nephrin and podocin, cause steroid-resistant proteinuria. In addition, mice lacking {CD2-associated} protein ({CD2AP)} develop a nephrotic syndrome that resembles {NPHS} mutations suggesting that all three proteins are essential for the integrity of glomerular podocytes. Although the precise glomerular function of either protein remains unknown, it has been suggested that nephrin forms zipper-like interactions to maintain the structure of podocyte foot processes. We demonstrate now that nephrin is a signaling molecule, which stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinases. Nephrin-induced signaling is greatly enhanced by podocin, which binds to the cytoplasmic tail of nephrin. Mutational analysis suggests that abnormal or inefficient signaling through the nephrin-podocin complex contributes to the development of podocyte dysfunction and proteinuria.},

One of these genes, mec-3, encodes a transcription factor that controls touch receptor differentiation. By culturing and isolating wild-type and mec-3 mutant cells from embryos and applying their amplified {RNA} to {DNA} microarrays, here we have identified genes that are known to be expressed in touch receptors, a previously uncloned gene (mec-17) that is needed for maintaining touch receptor differentiation, and more than 50 previously unknown mec-3-dependent genes. These genes are randomly distributed in the genome and under-represented both for genes that are co-expressed in operons and for multiple members of gene families. Using regions 5' of the start codon of the first 20 genes, we have also identified an over-represented heptanucleotide, {AATGCAT}, that is needed for the expression of touch receptor genes.},

	abstract = {The action of nuclear hormone receptors is tripartite, involving the receptor, its ligands, and its coregulator proteins. The estrogen receptor ({ER)}, a member of this superfamily, is a hormone-activated transcription factor that mediates the stimulatory effects of estrogens and the inhibitory effects of antiestrogens such as tamoxifen in breast cancer and other estrogen target cells. To understand how antiestrogens and dominant negative {ERs} suppress {ER} activity, we used a dominant negative {ER} as bait in two-hybrid screening assays from which we isolated a clone from breast cancer cells that potentiates the inhibitory activities of dominant negative {ERs} and antiestrogen-liganded {ER.} At higher concentrations, it also represses the transcriptional activity of the estradiol-liganded {ER}, while having no effect on other nuclear hormone receptors. This clone, denoted {REA} for "repressor of estrogen receptor activity," encodes a 37-{kDa} protein that is an {ER-selective} coregulator. Its competitive reversal of steroid receptor coactivator 1 enhancement of {ER} activity and its direct interaction with liganded {ER} suggest that it may play an important role in determining the sensitivity of estrogen target cells, including breast cancer cells, to antiestrogens and estrogens.},

Sloth bears (Melursus ursinus) are the only species of ursid specifically adapted to feed on insects, especially termites and ants, although they also feed on fruits when available. We studied diets of sloth bears in Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal, where fruits are available for ca. 4 months (May-August) and access to colonies of termites is reduced in lowlands that are flooded during the fruiting season. We analyzed feces and observed sloth bears foraging to investigate their responses to changes in availability of food. Diets of sloth bears were dominated by insects ({\textgreater}90\%), especially termites (≥50\%), from September through April, but they relied heavily on fruits from May through August. Seasonal movements between lowland and upland habitats seemed to be prompted mainly by availability of termites. Termites were more dominant in the diets of sloth bears in our study than in a study conducted 20 years ago in Royal Chitwan National Park and in studies in India. The dietary shift of sloth bears in Royal Chitwan National Park may have been related to changes in habitat conditions associated with relocation of people out of the Park. It appears that sloth bears, like other bears but unlike other myrmecophagous mammals, can adapt their diet to changing food conditions.},

In activated T cells, {SLP-2} interacts with components of {TCR} signalosomes and with polymerized actin. More importantly, up-regulation of {SLP-2} expression in human T cell lines and primary peripheral blood T cells increases effector responses, whereas down-regulation of {SLP-2} expression correlates with loss of sustained {TCR} signaling and decreased T cell activation. Our data suggest that {SLP-2} is an important player in T cell activation by ensuring sustained {TCR} signaling, which is required for full effector T cell differentiation, and point to {SLP-2} as a potential target for immunomodulation.},

	abstract = {Nephrotic syndrome ({NS)} represents the association of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia. Steroid-resistant {NS} ({SRNS)} is defined by primary resistance to standard steroid therapy. It remains one of the most intractable causes of {ESRD} in the first two decades of life. Mutations in the {NPHS2} gene represent a frequent cause of {SRNS}, occurring in approximately 20 to 30\% of sporadic cases of {SRNS.} On the basis of a very small number of patients, it was suspected that children with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in {NPHS2} might exhibit primary steroid resistance and a decreased risk of {FSGS} recurrence after kidney transplantation. To test this hypothesis, {NPHS2} mutational analysis was performed with direct sequencing for 190 patients with {SRNS} from 165 different families and, as a control sample, 124 patients with steroid-sensitive {NS} from 120 families. Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in {NPHS2} were detected for 43 of 165 {SRNS} families (26\%). Conversely, no homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in {NPHS2} were observed for the 120 steroid-sensitive {NS} families. Recurrence of {FSGS} in a renal transplant was noted for seven of 20 patients with {SRNS} (35\%) without {NPHS2} mutations, whereas it occurred for only two of 24 patients with {SRNS} (8\%) with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in {NPHS2.} None of 29 patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in {NPHS2} who were treated with cyclosporine A or cyclophosphamide demonstrated complete remission of {NS.} It was concluded that patients with {SRNS} with homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in {NPHS2} do not respond to standard steroid treatment and have a reduced risk for recurrence of {FSGS} in a renal transplant. Because these findings might affect the treatment plan for childhood {SRNS}, it might be advisable to perform mutational analysis of {NPHS2}, if the patient consents, in parallel with the start of the first course of standard steroid therapy.},

One drawback, according to the authors, of the data publication metaphor is that it does not look at the “big picture,” i.e., it does not emphasize data interoperability among systems. In other words, the publisher publishes a data set and that is the end product without any regard to how it might work together with other data sets published by other publishers. While this might be true to an extent, interoperability between data sets comes from understanding their differences and how to let each compliment the other. Machine readability of data sets is another topic that helps to increase interoperability, but is outside the scope of this bibliography

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, gentle touch to the body wall is sensed by six mechanosensory neurons that express two amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel proteins ({DEG/ENaC).} These proteins, {MEC-4} and {MEC-10}, are required for touch sensation and can mutate to cause neuronal degeneration. Here we show that these mutant or 'd' forms of {MEC-4} and {MEC-10} produce a constitutively active, amiloride-sensitive ionic current when co-expressed in Xenopus oocytes, but not on their own. {MEC-2}, a stomatin-related protein needed for touch sensitivity, increased the activity of mutant channels about 40-fold and allowed currents to be detected with wild-type {MEC-4} and {MEC-10.} Whereas neither the central, stomatin-like domain of {MEC-2} nor human stomatin retained the activity of full-length {MEC-2}, both produced amiloride-sensitive currents with {MEC-4d.} Our findings indicate that {MEC-2} regulates {MEC-4/MEC-10} ion channels and raise the possibility that similar ion channels may be formed by stomatin-like proteins and {DEG/ENaC} proteins that are co-expressed in both vertebrates and invertebrates.

	abstract = {Reggie-1 and -2 proteins (flotillin-2 and -1 respectively) form their own type of non-caveolar membrane microdomains, which are involved in important cellular processes such as T-cell activation, phagocytosis and signalling mediated by the cellular prion protein and insulin; this is consistent with the notion that reggie microdomains promote protein assemblies and signalling. While it is generally known that membrane microdomains contain large multiprotein assemblies, the exact organization of reggie microdomains remains elusive. Using chemical cross-linking approaches, we have demonstrated that reggie complexes are composed of homo- and hetero-tetramers of reggie-1 and -2. Moreover, native reggie oligomers are indeed quite stable, since non-cross-linked tetramers are resistant to 8 M urea treatment. We also show that oligomerization requires the C-terminal but not the N-terminal halves of reggie-1 and -2. Using deletion constructs, we analysed the functional relevance of the three predicted coiled-coil stretches present in the C-terminus of reggie-1. We confirmed experimentally that reggie-1 tetramerization is dependent on the presence of coiled-coil 2 and, partially, of coiled-coil 1. Furthermore, since depletion of reggie-1 by {siRNA} (small interfering {RNA)} silencing induces proteasomal degradation of reggie-2, we conclude that the protein stability of reggie-2 depends on the presence of reggie-1. Our data indicate that the basic structural units of reggie microdomains are reggie homo- and hetero-tetramers, which are dependent on the presence of reggie-1.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Schistosomiasis affects more than 200 million individuals worldwide, with a further 650 million living at risk of infection, constituting a severe health problem in developing countries. Even though an effective treatment exists, it does not prevent re-infection, and the development of an effective vaccine still remains the most desirable means of control for this disease. {METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS:} Herein, we report the cloning and characterization of a S. mansoni Stomatin-like protein 2 ({SmStoLP-2).} In silico analysis predicts three putative sites for palmitoylation (Cys11, Cys61 and Cys330), which could contribute to protein membrane association; and a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence, similar to that described for human Stomatin-like protein 2 ({HuSLP-2).} The protein was detected by Western blot with comparable levels in all stages across the parasite life cycle. Fractionation by differential centrifugation of schistosome tegument suggested that {SmStoLP-2} displays a dual targeting to the tegument membranes and mitochondria; additionally, immunolocalization experiments confirm its localization in the tegument of the adult worms and, more importantly, in 7-day-old schistosomula. Analysis of the antibody isotype profile to {rSmStoLP-2} in the sera of patients living in endemic areas for schistosomiasis revealed that {IgG1}, {IgG2}, {IgG3} and {IgA} antibodies were predominant in sera of individuals resistant to reinfection as compared to those susceptible. Next, immunization of mice with {rSmStoLP-2} engendered a 30\%-32\% reduction in adult worm burden. Protective immunity in mice was associated with specific anti-{rSmStoLP-2} {IgG1} and {IgG2a} antibodies and elevated production of {IFN-gamma} and {TNF-alpha}, while no {IL-4} production was detected, suggesting a Th1-predominant immune response. {CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:} Data presented here demonstrate that {SmStoLP-2} is a novel tegument protein located in the host-parasite interface. It is recognized by different subclasses of antibodies in patients resistant and susceptible to reinfection and, based on the data from murine studies, shows protective potential against schistosomiasis. These results indicate that {SmStoLP-2} could be useful in a combination vaccine.},

Seven of them were polymorphic, which led us to investigate several population-genetic parameters. Private alleles and significant differences in gene frequencies were found among the populations studied, which demonstrated the extent of genetic differentiation among the spectacled bear populations. The levels of gene diversity measured with these microsatellites were rather modest in this species. Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium was especially found for the overall and the Ecuadorian samples, and might be due to the Wahl-und effect or consanguinity. Significant genetic heterogeneity was mainly observed among the Colombian and the Ecuadorian populations. Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations clearly showed that two different gene pools were present, one present in the Venezuelan-Colombian bears and other in the Ecuadorian ones.},

The aim of this work was to obtain evidence for lipid domain phenomena in plant membranes. A protocol to prepare Triton X-100 detergent-resistant membranes ({DRMs)} was developed using Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) callus membranes. A comparative proteomics approach using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed that the {DRMs} were highly enriched in specific proteins. They included eight glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, several plasma membrane ({PM)} {ATPases}, multidrug resistance proteins, and proteins of the stomatin/prohibitin/hypersensitive response family, suggesting that the {DRMs} originated from {PM} domains. We also identified a plant homolog of flotillin, a major mammalian {DRM} protein, suggesting a conserved role for this protein in lipid domain phenomena in eukaryotic cells. Lipid analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that the {DRMs} had a 4-fold higher sterol-to-protein content than the average for Arabidopsis membranes. The {DRMs} were also 5-fold increased in sphingolipid-to-protein ratio. Our results indicate that the preparation of {DRMs} can yield a very specific set of membrane proteins and suggest that the {PM} contains phytosterol and sphingolipid-rich lipid domains with a specialized protein composition. Our results also suggest a conserved role of lipid modification in targeting proteins to both the intracellular and extracellular leaflet of these domains. The proteins associated with these domains provide important new experimental avenues into understanding plant cell polarity and cell surface processes.},

Here, we report the systematic screening of Caenorhabditis elegans mitochondrial proteins required to maintain the morphology of the organelle using an {RNA} interference feeding library. In C. elegans body wall muscle cells, mitochondria usually formed tubular structures and were severely fragmented by the mutation in fzo-1 gene, indicating that the body wall muscle cells are suitable for monitoring changes in mitochondrial morphology due to gene silencing. Of 719 genes predicted to code for most of mitochondrial proteins, knockdown of {\textgreater}80\% of them caused abnormal mitochondrial morphology, including fragmentation and elongation. These findings indicate that most fundamental mitochondrial functions, including metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation, are necessary for maintenance of the tubular networks as well as membrane fission and fusion. This is the first evidence that known mitochondrial activities are prerequisite for regulating the morphology of the organelle. Furthermore, 88 uncharacterized or poorly characterized genes were found in the screening to be implicated in mitochondrial morphology.},

	abstract = {Understanding mechanisms that orchestrate cell behavior into appropriately patterned tissues and organs within the organism is an essential element of preventing, detecting and treating cancer. Bioelectric signals (resting transmembrane voltage potential gradients in all cells) underlie an important and broadly conserved set of control mechanisms that regulate pattern formation. We tested the role of transmembrane potential in tumorigenesis mediated by canonical oncogenes in Xenopus laevis. Depolarized membrane potential (Vmem) was a characteristic of induced tumor-like structures ({ITLSs)} generated by overexpression of Gli1, {KrasG12D}, Xrel3 or {p53Trp248.} This bioelectric signature was also present in precursor {ITLS} sites. Vmem is a bioelectric marker that reveals {ITLSs} before they become histologically and morphologically apparent. Moreover, voltage was functionally important: overexpression of hyperpolarizing ion transporters caused a return to normal Vmem and significantly reduced {ITLS} formation in vivo. To characterize the molecular mechanism by which Vmem change regulates {ITLS} phenotypes, we performed a suppression screen. Vmem hyperpolarization was transduced into downstream events via Vmem-regulated activity of {SLC5A8}, a sodium-butyrate exchanger previously implicated in human cancer. These data indicate that butyrate, a histone deacetylase ({HDAC)} inhibitor, might be responsible for transcriptional events that mediate suppression of {ITLSs} by hyperpolarization. Vmem is a convenient cellular parameter by which tumors induced by human oncogenes can be detected in vivo and represents a new diagnostic modality. Moreover, control of resting membrane potential is functionally involved in the process by which oncogene-bearing cells depart from normal morphogenesis programs to form tumors. Modulation of Vmem levels is a novel and promising strategy for tumor normalization.},

	abstract = {Stomatin is an integral membrane protein which is widely expressed in many cell types. It is accepted that stomatin has a unique hairpin-loop topology: it is anchored to the membrane with an N-terminal hydrophobic domain and the N- and C-termini are cytoplasmically localized. Stomatin is a prototype for a family of related proteins, containing among others {MEC-2} (mechanosensory protein 2) from Caenorhabditis elegans, {SLP} (stomatin-like protein)-3 and podocin, all of which interact with ion channels to regulate their activity. Members of the stomatin family partly localize in {DRMs} (detergent-resistant membrane domains) enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. It has been proposed that a highly conserved proline residue in the middle of the hydrophobic domain directly binds cholesterol and that cholesterol binding is necessary for the regulation of ion channels. In the present study we show that a small part of the stomatin pool exists as a single-pass transmembrane protein rather than a hairpin-loop protein. The highly conserved proline residue is crucial for adopting the hairpin-loop topology: substitution of this proline residue by serine transfers the whole stomatin pool to the single-pass transmembrane form, which no longer localizes to {DRMs.} These results suggest that formation of the hairpin loop is inefficient and that the conserved proline residue is indispensable for formation of the hairpin loop. The single-pass transmembrane form exists also for {SLP-3} and it should be considered that it mediates part of the physiological functions of stomatin and related proteins.},

This structure suggests a role for {SLP-1} in sterol/lipid transfer and transport. Because {SLP-1} has not been investigated, we first studied the molecular and cell biological characteristics of the expressed protein. We show here that {SLP-1} localizes to the late endosomal compartment, like stomatin. Unlike stomatin, {SLP-1} does not localize to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of {SLP-1} leads to the redistribution of stomatin from the plasma membrane to late endosomes suggesting a complex formation between these proteins. We found that the targeting of {SLP-1} to late endosomes is caused by a {GYΦ} (Φ being a bulky, hydrophobic amino acid) sorting signal at the N terminus. Mutation of this signal results in plasma membrane localization. {SLP-1} and stomatin co-localize in the late endosomal compartment, they co-immunoprecipitate, thus showing a direct interaction, and they associate with detergent-resistant membranes. In accordance with the proposed lipid transfer function, we show that, under conditions of blocked cholesterol efflux from late endosomes, {SLP-1} induces the formation of enlarged, cholesterol-filled, weakly {LAMP-2-positive}, acidic vesicles in the perinuclear region. This massive cholesterol accumulation clearly depends on the {SCP-2} domain of {SLP-1}, suggesting a role for this domain in cholesterol transfer to late endosomes.},

Complex tissues, such as the pharynx, intestine, gonad, as well as scaffolding tissues and guidepost cells express a variety of innexins in overlapping or complementary patterns, suggesting they may form heteromeric and heterotypic channels. Innexin expression occurs in several types of cells that are not known to form gap junctions as well as in a pair of migrating cells, suggesting they may have hemichannel function. Therefore, innexins likely play roles in almost all body functions, including embryonic development, cell fate determination, oogenesis, egg laying, pharyngeal pumping, excretion, and locomotion.},

Current procedures to assure quality and fairness seem to discourage scientific advancement, especially important innovations, because findings that conflict with current beliefs are often judged to have defects. Editors can use procedures to encourage the publication of papers with innovative findings such as invited papers, early-acceptance procedures, author nominations of reviewers, structured rating sheets, open peer review, results-blind review, and, in particular, electronic publication. Some journals are currently using these procedures. The basic principle behind the proposals is to change the decision from whether to publish a paper to how to publish it.},

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans "memorizes" temperatures, and this stored information modifies its subsequent migration along a temperature gradient. We show that the olfactory neuron designated {AWC} senses temperature. Calcium imaging revealed that {AWC} responds to temperature changes and that response thresholds differ depending on the temperature to which the animal was previously exposed. In the mutant with impaired heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-mediated signaling, {AWC} was hyperresponsive to temperature, whereas the {AIY} interneuron (which is postsynaptic to {AWC)} was hyporesponsive to temperature. Thus, temperature sensation exhibits a robust influence on a neural circuit controlling a memory-regulated behavior.},

In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, neuronal circuits have been delineated based on patterns of synaptic connectivity derived from ultrastructural analysis. Individual cellular components of these anatomically defined circuits have previously been characterized on the sensory and motor neuron levels. In contrast, interneuron function has only been addressed to a limited extent. We describe here several classes of interneurons ({AIY}, {AIZ}, and {RIB)} that modulate locomotory behavior in C. elegans. Using mutant analysis as well as microsurgical mapping techniques, we found that the {AIY} neuron class serves to tonically modulate reversal frequency of animals in various sensory environments via the repression of the activity of a bistable switch composed of defined command interneurons. Furthermore, we show that the presentation of defined sensory modalities induces specific alterations in reversal behavior and that the {AIY} interneuron class mediates this alteration in locomotory behavior. We also found that the {AIZ} and {RIB} interneuron classes process odorsensory information in parallel to the {AIY} interneuron class. {AIY}, {AIZ}, and {RIB} are the first interneurons directly implicated in chemosensory signaling. Our neuronal mapping studies provide the framework for further genetic and functional dissections of neuronal circuits in C. elegans.},

	abstract = {There is a need to establish a new publishing paradigm to cope with the deluge of data artifacts produced by data-intensive science, many of which are vital to data re-use and verification of published scientific conclusions. Due to the limitations of traditional publishing, most of these artifacts are not usually disseminated, cited, or preserved. These latent artifacts consist largely of datasets and data processing information that together form the foundations of the reasoned analyses that appear in the published literature. But this traditional record of science increasingly represents only the tip of the scientific iceberg. One promising approach to this problem of data invisibility is to wrap these artifacts in the metaphor of a “data paper”, a somewhat unfamiliar bundle of scholarly output with a familiar facade. As envisioned, a data paper minimally consists of a cover sheet and a set of links to archived artifacts. The cover sheet contains familiar elements such as title, authors, date, abstract, and persistent identifier (e.g., a {DOI} or {ARK)} — just enough to permit basic exposure to and discovery of data by internet search engines; also just enough to build a basic data citation, to instill confidence in the identifier’s stability, and to be picked up by indexing services such as Google Scholar. This simple format represents only the first stage of the evolution of the data paper. There is room for the format to increase in complexity with the incorporation of other valuable elements, both general-purpose and discipline-specific, to enrich discovery, re-use, and archiving. An exciting potential outcome of this development of the data paper as publication is the parallel emergence of a new kind of “data journal”. Like regular journals, data journals would spring up around disciplines and sub-disciplines as needed, and we could expect that some of them would also be peer-reviewed. The data journal is envisioned as an “overlay” journal; an editor would assemble an issue by selecting data papers from any number of source and archives, and combining them with front matter, a table of contents, editorial policies, submission guidelines, etc. This new data publishing paradigm promises to strengthen the scientific community practices of data sharing, re-use, and preservation. Scientists want to do science, get credit for it, communicate about it with their peers, and improve the measurable outputs by which their funders and employers evaluate their performance. The elements of the data paper create a recognizable and standardized form for previously unpublished data artifacts, making them easier to approach, evaluate, and automatically index for basic discovery purposes. Those same elements can easily be repurposed to create familiar-looking citations suitable for reference in {CVs} and all manner of publication. Finally, unique persistent identifiers for data papers and data artifacts greatly facilitate automatic discovery of a data paper’s impact and re-use.},

A {PROSITE-formatted} regular expression was generated that is highly predictive for identifying members of this superfamily using {PHI-BLAST.} The superfamily is named {PID} (proliferation, ion, and death) because prohibitins are involved in proliferation and cell cycle control, stomatins are involved in ion channel regulation, and the plant defense-related genes are involved in cell death. The plant defense gene family is named {HIR} (hypersensitive induced reaction) because its members are associated with hypersensitive reactions involving cell death and pathogen resistance. For this study, eight novel maize genes were introduced: four closely related to prohibitins (Zm-phb1, Zm-phb2, Zm-phb3, and Zm-phb4), one to stomatins (Zm-stm1), and three to a gene implicated in plant disease responses (Zm-hir1, Zm-hir2, and Zm-hir3). The maize Zm-hir3 gene transcript is up-regulated in a disease lesion mimic mutation (Les9), supporting a role in maize defense responses. Members of this gene superfamily are involved in diverse functions, but their structural similarity suggests a conserved molecular mechanism, which we postulate to be ion channel regulation.},

	abstract = {In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content: For the last two years, I have worked in collaboration with the Institute for the Future of the Book, my colleague Avi Santo, and a range of prominent scholars in media studies, on the development of {MediaCommons}, an all-electronic scholarly publishing network. We have planned, we have blogged, we have held meetings, we have tested some small-scale implementations of the technologies the full network will employ, we have published a few test-run articles—and in all of the feedback that we have received, in all of the conversations we have had with scholars both senior and junior, both beginning and established, one question has repeatedly resurfaced: What are you going to do about peer review? I have suggested elsewhere that peer review threatens to become the axle around which the whole issue of electronic scholarly publishing gets wrapped, like Isadora Duncan's scarf, choking the life out of many innovative systems before they are fully able to establish themselves.1 This is a flippant response, to be sure; concerns about peer review are understandable, given that peer review is in some sense the sine qua non of the academy. We employ it in almost every aspect of the ways that we work, from hiring decisions through tenure and promotion reviews, in both internal and external grant and fellowship competitions, and, of course, in publishing. The work we do as scholars is repeatedly subjected to a series of vetting processes that enable us to indicate that the results of our work have been scrutinized by authorities in the field, and that those results are, therefore, themselves authoritative. But, as authors including Michael Jensen of the National Academies Press have recently argued, the nature of authority is shifting, and shifting dramatically, in the era of the digital network.2 Scholars in media studies have avidly explored such shifts as they affect media production, distribution, and consumption, focusing on the extent to which, for instance, bloggers have decentralized and even displaced the authority structures surrounding traditional journalism, or the ways that a range of phenomena including mash-ups and fan vids have disrupted the previously assumed hierarchies that existed between media producers and media consumers, or the growing tensions in the relationship between consumers, industries, and industry regulators highlighted by file-sharing services and battles with the {RIAA.} These changes are at the heart of much of the most exciting and influential work in media studies today, including publications such as Siva Vaidhyanathan's The Anarchist in the Library, Henry Jenkins's Convergence Culture, and Yochai Benkler's The Wealth of Networks, projects that have grown out of an understandable interest in the extent to which the means of media production and distribution are undergoing a process of radical democratization in the Web 2.0 era, and a desire to test the limits of that democratization. To a surprising extent, however, scholars have resisted exploring a similar sense in which intellectual authority might likewise be shifting in the contemporary world. One might see such a resistance manifested in the often overblown academic response to Wikipedia, which often indicates a serious misunderstanding about the value of the project. Treating Wikipedia like any other encyclopedia, by consulting only the entries, as John Seely Brown has been heard to say, runs the risk of missing the point entirely, as the real intellectual heart of the project lies in the history and discussion pages, where one can see the controversies inherent in the production of any encyclopedia entry enacted in public, rather than smoothed over into an untroubled conventional wisdom.3 Centralized projects like Citizendium, which seek to impose traditional, hierarchical modes of authority on a site like Wikipedia,4 ignore the fact that, first, the wiki is in its very architecture a mode of ongoing peer review, and second, that not only the results of that review, but the records of its process are available for critical scrutiny. Failing to engage fully with the intellectual merits of a project like Wikipedia, or with the ways in which it represents one facet of a far-reaching change in contemporary epistemologies, is a mistake that we academics make at our own peril.

	abstract = {The cytoplasmically oriented monotopic integral membrane protein stomatin forms high-order oligomers and associates with lipid rafts. To characterize the domains that are involved in oligomerization and detergent-resistant membrane ({DRM)} association, we expressed truncation and point mutants of stomatin and analyzed their size and buoyancy by ultracentrifugation methods. A small C-terminal region of stomatin that is largely hydrophobic, Ser-Thr-Ile-Val-Phe-Pro-Leu-Pro-Ile (residues 264-272), proved to be crucial for oligomerization, whereas the N-terminal domain (residues 1-20) and the last 12 C-terminal amino acids (residues 276-287) were not essential. The introduction of alanine substitutions in the region 264-272 resulted in the appearance of monomers. Remarkably, only three of these residues, Ile-Val-Phe (residues 266-268), were found to be indispensable for the {DRM} association. Interestingly, the exchange of Pro-269 and to some extent the residues 270-272, which are essential for oligomerization, did not affect the {DRM} association of stomatin. This suggests that the formation of oligomers is not necessary for the association of stomatin with {DRMs.} Internal deletions near the membrane anchoring domain resulted in the formation of intermediate size oligomers suggesting a conformational interdependence of large parts of the C-terminal region. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis of the tagged, monomeric, non-{DRM} mutant {ST-(1-262)-green} fluorescent protein and wild type stomatin {StomGFP} showed a significantly higher lateral mobility of the truncation mutant in the plasma membrane suggesting a membrane interaction of the respective C-terminal region also in vivo.},

	abstract = {The {cII} gene product of bacteriophage lambda is unstable and required for the establishment of lysogenization. Its intracellular amount is important for the decision between lytic growth and lysogenization. Two genetic loci of Escherichia coli are crucial for these commitments of infecting lambda genome. One of them, {hflA} encodes the {HflKC} membrane protein complex, which has been believed to be a protease degrading the {cII} protein. However, both its absence and overproduction stabilized {cII} in vivo and the proposed serine protease-like sequence motif in {HflC} was dispensable for the lysogenization control. Moreover, the {HflKC} protein was found to reside on the periplasmic side of the plasma membrane. In contrast, the other host gene, {ftsH} ({hflB)} encoding an integral membrane {ATPase/protease}, is positively required for degradation of {cII}, since loss of its function stabilized {cII} and its overexpression accelerated the {cII} degradation. In vitro, purified {FtsH} catalyzed {ATP-dependent} proteolysis of {cII} and {HflKC} antagonized the {FtsH} action. These results, together with our previous finding that {FtsH} and {HflKC} form a complex, suggest that {FtsH} is the {cII} degrading protease and {HflKC} is a modulator of the {FtsH} function. We propose that this transmembrane modulation differentiates the {FtsH} actions to different substrate proteins such as the membrane-bound {SecY} protein and the cytosolic {cII} protein. This study necessitates a revision of the prevailing view about the host control over lambda lysogenic decision.},

The defecation motor program is activated every 45 sec, and this rhythm is temperature compensated. We describe mutations in 12 genes that either shorten or lengthen the cycle period. We find that most of these mutations also disrupt temperature compensation, suggesting that this process is an integral part of the clock.

The membrane targeting and activation of C-Raf by Ras needs prohibitin in vivo. In addition, direct interaction with prohibitin is required for C-Raf activation. C-Raf kinase fails to interact with the active Ras induced by epidermal growth factor in the absence of prohibitin. Moreover, in prohibitin-deficient cells the adhesion complex proteins cadherin and beta-catenin relocalize to the plasma membrane and thereby stabilize adherens junctions. Our data show an unexpected role of prohibitin in the activation of the Ras-Raf signalling pathway and in modulating epithelial cell adhesion and migration.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Research in evolution requires software for visualizing and editing phylogenetic trees, for increasingly very large datasets, such as arise in expression analysis or metagenomics, for example. It would be desirable to have a program that provides these services in an efficient and user-friendly way, and that can be easily installed and run on all major operating systems. Although a large number of tree visualization tools are freely available, some as a part of more comprehensive analysis packages, all have drawbacks in one or more domains. They either lack some of the standard tree visualization techniques or basic graphics and editing features, or they are restricted to small trees containing only tens of thousands of taxa. Moreover, many programs are difficult to install or are not available for all common operating systems. {RESULTS:} We have developed a new program, Dendroscope, for the interactive visualization and navigation of phylogenetic trees. The program provides all standard tree visualizations and is optimized to run interactively on trees containing hundreds of thousands of taxa. The program provides tree editing and graphics export capabilities. To support the inspection of large trees, Dendroscope offers a magnification tool. The software is written in Java 1.4 and installers are provided for {Linux/Unix}, {MacOS} X and Windows {XP.} {CONCLUSION:} Dendroscope is a user-friendly program for visualizing and navigating phylogenetic trees, for both small and large datasets.},

These studies define a complex molecular structure with a set of minimal amplified regions, and different putative oncogenes that show a strong correlation between amplification and over-expression such as {ZNF703/FLJ14299}, {SPFH2/C8orf2}, {BRF2} and {RAB11FIP.} However, none of these studies were carried out on familial breast malignancies. We have studied the incidence, molecular features and clinical value of this amplification in familial breast tumors associated with {BRCA1}, {BRCA2} and non-{BRCA1/2} gene mutations. We detected 9 out of 80 familial tumors with this amplicon by chromosomal comparative genomic hybridization. Next, we used a high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization array covering the 8p11-12 region to characterize this chromosomal region. This approach allowed us to define 2 cores of common amplification that largely overlap with those reported in sporadic tumors. Our findings confirm the molecular complexity of this chromosomal region and indicate that this genomic event is a common alteration in breast cancer, present not only in sporadic but also in familial tumors. Finally, we found correlation between the 8p11-12 amplification and proliferation (Ki-67) and cyclin E expression, which further proves in familial tumors the poor prognosis association previously reported in sporadic breast cancer.},

	abstract = {One of the primary threats to Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus) populations in Ecuador is conversion of bear habitat to human uses, resulting in habitat loss and fragmentation. To develop science-based conservation plans, information on the suitability and distribution of Andean bear habitat is critically needed. We studied habitat use in the 721-km$^{\textrm{2}}$ Oyacachi River Basin in the eastern Andes Mountains. We used bimonthly sign surveys along 1.6-km transects (n = 53) to determine habitat use. We recorded 549 and 202 locations of bear activity during 2000 and 2001, respectively; feeding signs were recorded most frequently (53.3\%), followed by scats (19.6\%), footprints (13.4\%), hair (6.9\%), tree marks (4.8\%), trails (1.2\%), and ground nests (0.8\%). The combined total distance of surveyed transects for both years was 1,018 km with a corresponding sign encounter rate of 0.74/km. Use of the different vegetation types within the study area varied among the bimonthly sampling periods. Habitat suitability was calculated with a geographic information system ({GIS)} based on Mahalanobis distance {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$(D{\textasciicircum}\{2\})\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}, a multivariate measure of dissimilarity, using 8 habitat variables and 437 bear locations. Model validity was confirmed by testing whether the D$^{\textrm{2}}$ values of 61 random locations in the Oyacachi River Basin were greater than those associated with 61 test locations. We used a cumulative frequency curve based on D$^{\textrm{2}}$ values associated with the 61 independent test locations to define 5 classes of habitat suitability, ranging from most used to avoided areas. The most suitable habitat class occupied 86.3 km$^{\textrm{2}}$ (11.9\%) of the study area. The results of our study may be applied on a regional scale to define priority conservation areas for Andean bears in the eastern Andes Mountains of Ecuador. Our results indicate the usefulness of field-based studies combined with {GIS} and statistical analyses as a scientific basis for developing conservation strategies for Andean bears on a landscape scale.},

Most patients with {INS} respond to steroid therapy. {INS} is generally regarded as a sporadic disease with favorable outcome. We investigated a distinct subgroup of nephrosis--the familial form of steroid resistant {INS} ({SRN).} These patients always progress to end-stage renal failure within a few years and show absence of recurrence of the disease after renal transplantation. The occurrence of the disorder in siblings and the high incidence of inbreeding in these families made an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance very likely. We performed whole genome linkage analysis in nine multiplex families of European or Northern African origin. Our results allowed us to assign a disease locus ({SRN1)} to a defined chromosomal region on 1q25-1q31, thus confirming the existence of a distinct entity of autosomal recessive nephrosis. Exclusion of linkage to the entire region in one family proves genetic heterogeneity.},

How can an embedded research informationist add value to the scientific output of research teams?

Setting:
The University of {California–Los} Angeles ({UCLA)} Louise M. Darling Biomedical Library is an academic health sciences library serving the clinical, educational, and research needs of the {UCLA} community.

Methods:
A grant from the National Library of Medicine funded a librarian to join a {UCLA} research team as an informationist. The informationist meets regularly with the research team and provides guidance related to data management, preservation, and other information-related issues.

Main Results:
Early results suggest that the informationist's involvement has influenced the team's data gathering, storage, and curation methods. The {UCLA} Library has also changed the librarian's title to research informationist to reflect the new activities that she performs.

Conclusion:
The research informationist role provides an opportunity for librarians to become effective members of research teams and improve research output.},

The nature of the interactions involved and the different mechanisms through which membrane proteins segregate lipid domains are presented, in particular with regard to those induced by the {nAChR.} It may be concluded that coupling of favourable lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interactions is a general condition for this phenomenon to occur.},

Out of all depredation incidents, Tiger was   involved in 21 incidents (37\%), Leopard in 27 incidents (47\%), Jackal in   5 incidents (9\%) and wolf involved in 4 incidents (7\%). According to   respondents, Leopard is the most common agent for livestock damage and   Sloth Bear for human casualty. The study revealed that in monsoon, the   highest number of livestock depredation incident occurred, when the   highest number of human casualty reported in winter. Conflicts create   negative impact on local community, but they still positive towards   carnivore conservation.

	abstract = {The two prohibitin proteins, Phb1p and Phb2p({BAP37)}, have been ascribed various functions, including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzymes, and aging. We show that the mammalian prohibitins are present in the inner mitochondrial membrane and are always bound to each other, with no free protein detectable. They are coexpressed during development and in adult mammalian tissues, and expression levels are indicative of a role in mitochondrial metabolism, but are not compatible with roles in the regulation of cellular proliferation or apoptosis. High level expression of the proteins is consistently seen in primary human tumors, while cellular senescence of human and chick fibroblasts is accompanied by heterogeneous decreases in both proteins. The two proteins are induced by metabolic stress caused by an imbalance in the synthesis of mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, but do not respond to oxidative stress, heat shock, or other cellular stresses. The gene promoter sequences contain binding sites for the Myc oncoprotein and overexpression of Myc induces expression of the prohibitins. The data support conserved roles for the prohibitins in regulating mitochondrial respiratory activity and in aging.},

The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can sense a range of environmental temperatures and migrate towards the cultivation temperature on a thermal gradient. This modifiable thermotactic response provides an ideal system for studying the cellular and molecular processes involved in thermosensation and thermal information storage. We have identified neurons critical for thermotaxis by killing individual cells in live animals. The results indicate that an amphid sensory neuron, {AFD}, is a major thermosensory neuron. Some of the genetically defined cryophilic and thermophilic mutant phenotypes were mimicked when amphid interneurons {AIY} and {AIZ}, respectively, were killed, indicating that {AIY} is responsible for thermophilic movement and {AIZ} for cryophilic movement. We propose a neural model in which regulation of the activities of the two interneurons in opposite directions, depending on the cultivation temperature, is essential for thermotaxis.},

	abstract = {A guanylyl cyclase ({GC-D)} was recently shown to be expressed in a subclass of neurons within the neuroepithelim of the rat, but given that only a single cyclase was discovered, whether it represents an odorant/pheromone receptor as has been suggested for the large family of seven-transmembrane receptors remains unclear. Through cloning and expression of {cDNA} we now demonstrate that at least 29 genomic or {cDNA} sequences found in Caenorhabditis elegans represent guanylyl cyclases. Many of the membrane forms retain cysteine residues conserved within the extracellular, ligand-binding domain of known cyclase receptors. Of eight orphan cyclase {receptor::GFP} (green fluroescence protein) fusion constructs for which signals were obtained, all were expressed in specific sensory neurons. Furthermore, a {cyclase/GFP} fusion protein ({GCY-10/GFP)} was principally expressed in the sensory cilium, suggesting these cyclases function as primary chemosensory receptors. For the first time, we also found that chemosensory neurons ({ASE)}, known to be bilaterally symmetric, demonstrate absolute right or left sidedness with respect to the expression of three different cyclases. Thus, the guanylyl cyclases represent an unexpectedly large and new family of sensory neuron receptors that may complement the 7-transmembrane family of odorant/pheromone receptors.},

Firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to down-weight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. Secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. Thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. Fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions.

Here, we show that distinct sensory functions arise from different combinations of {OSM-9} and related {OCR} {TRPV} proteins. Both {OSM-9} and {OCR-2} are essential for several forms of sensory transduction, including olfaction, osmosensation, mechanosensation, and chemosensation. In neurons that express both {OSM-9} and {OCR-2}, tagged {OCR-2} and {OSM-9} proteins reside in sensory cilia and promote each other's localization to cilia. In neurons that express only {OSM-9}, tagged {OSM-9} protein resides in the cell body and acts in sensory adaptation rather than sensory transduction. Thus, alternative combinations of {TRPV} proteins may direct different functions in distinct subcellular locations. Animals expressing the mammalian {TRPV1} ({VR1)} channel in {ASH} nociceptor neurons avoid the {TRPV1} ligand capsaicin, allowing selective, drug-inducible activation of a specific behavior.},

	abstract = {The two major functions of a scientific publishing system are to provide access to and evaluation of scientific papers. While open access ({OA)} is becoming a reality, open evaluation ({OE)}, the other side of the coin, has received less attention. Evaluation steers the attention of the scientific community and thus the very course of science. It also influences the use of scientific findings in public policy. The current system of scientific publishing provides only journal prestige as an indication of the quality of new papers and relies on a non-transparent and noisy pre-publication peer-review process, which delays publication by many months on average. Here I propose an {OE} system, in which papers are evaluated post-publication in an ongoing fashion by means of open peer review and rating. Through signed ratings and reviews, scientists steer the attention of their field and build their reputation. Reviewers are motivated to be objective, because low-quality or self-serving signed evaluations will negatively impact their reputation. A core feature of this proposal is a division of powers between the accumulation of evaluative evidence and the analysis of this evidence by paper evaluation functions ({PEFs).} {PEFs} can be freely defined by individuals or groups (e.g., scientific societies) and provide a plurality of perspectives on the scientific literature. Simple {PEFs} will use averages of ratings, weighting reviewers (e.g., by H-index), and rating scales (e.g., by relevance to a decision process) in different ways. Complex {PEFs} will use advanced statistical techniques to infer the quality of a paper. Papers with initially promising ratings will be more deeply evaluated. The continual refinement of {PEFs} in response to attempts by individuals to influence evaluations in their own favor will make the system ungameable. {OA} and {OE} together have the power to revolutionize scientific publishing and usher in a new culture of transparency, constructive criticism, and collaboration.},

	abstract = {This article analyses the transformation of the familiar, linear scientific information chain into an interactive scientific communication network in response to concomitant changes in scientific research and education. Societal conditions are seen to lead to the concept of strategic research world-wide: research dominated by "economy of scope". Strategic research leads to transnational research enterprises - universities and other research institutions-with a focus on return of research capital investment, and thus on intellectual capital. This development calls for new ways of knowledge management that in turn has consequences for scientific communication.
The scientific communication market is described in terms of four main forces and their interplay. These forces are the actor pair (author/reader), accessibility, content, and applicability. Scientific communication is described in terms of its four functions: registration, awareness, certification and archive.
These forces and functions allow a strategic analysis of the scientific communication market and allow to discuss aspects of strategic correspondence to be applicable in e.g. describing the transformation from a paper-based system to communication in an electronic environment. The developments in research are seen to emphasize the already existing autonomous development of a "unified archive", lead us to review certification policies to include elements external to research and lead us to consider new structures for communication, and publications. The new structures are a result of the interactions in the market as described through the forces and the functions. The distinction between formal and informal communication is seen to become less useful. The need to review the structure and organization of the market becomes evident, in particular if we consider communication during research as well. This leads us to speculate if elements of the virtual organization are of relevance. Finally, the need for a coherent research programme on scientific communication is discussed.},

The {STOML2} {cDNA} encoded a 356 amino acid residue polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 38.5 {kDa.} The predicted polypeptide sequence of {STOML2} could be delineated into three major domains: an N-terminal alpha-helical region; a domain with significant similarity to a 172 amino acid region of the {HSA} stomatin polypeptide, composed of an alternating alpha-helical and beta-sheet structure and a C-terminal domain that was mostly alpha-helical. The stomatin-like domain was observed in 51 other proteins with potentially diverse functions. Based on its homology to stomatin, {STOML2} was predicted to be cytoplasmically located. However, unlike most of the other proteins containing stomatin-like domains, the predicted {STOML2} polypeptide does not contain a transmembrane region although the presence of N-myristoylation sites suggest that it has the potential to be membrane-associated. Northern blot analysis of a panel of poly(A)(+) {mRNA} from normal human adult tissues showed that a single 1.3-kb {mRNA} transcript encoding {STOML2} was ubiquitously expressed, with relatively higher levels in skeletal muscle and heart compared to other tissues. Comparison of the {STOML2} {cDNA} sequence with human genomic {DNA} indicated that the gene encoding {STOML2} was 3,250 bp long and consisted of ten exons interrupted by nine introns. We have mapped {STOML2} to {HSA} chromosome 9p13.1, a region that is rearranged in some cancers and thought to contain the gene responsible for acromesomelic dysplasia.},

	abstract = {Stomatin-like protein 2 ({SLP-2)} is a novel cancer-related gene whose product promotes cell growth, tumorigenicity, and adhesion in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether {SLP-2} is overexpressed in human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma ({LSCC)} and, if so, the significance of its overexpression in relation to clinical parameters. By analyzing 124 cases of {LSCC} with a tissue microarray, we concluded that {SLP-2} is overexpressed in {LSCC} as compared with the adjacent normal laryngeal epithelium (P = .000) and furthermore that {SLP-2} expression correlates with clinical stage. Overexpression can be regarded as a significant prognostic factor, with higher expression being found in lymph node metastasis.},

	abstract = {Estrogen antagonists are universally employed in the breast cancer therapy, although antagonist therapy is limited by the inevitable development of cellular resistance. The molecular mechanisms by which these agents inhibit cellular proliferation in breast cancer cells are not fully defined. Recent studies have shown the involvement of the {E2F} pathway in tamoxifen-induced growth arrest. We show that an {E2F} repressor, prohibitin, and the chromatin modifiers {Brg1/Brm} are required for estrogen antagonist-mediated growth suppression through the estrogen receptor, and that their recruitment to native promoter-bound {E2F} is induced via a {JNK1} pathway. In addition, we demonstrate major mechanistic differences among the signaling pathways initiated by estrogen, estrogen deprivation, and estrogen antagonists. Collectively, these findings suggest that the {prohibitin/Brg1/Brm} node is a major cellular target for estrogen antagonists, and thereby also implicate {prohibitin/Brg1/Brm} as potentially important targets for breast cancer therapy.},

We have now isolated {SecY-stabilizing} mutations that cause an amino acid substitution in the {HflK-HflC} membrane protein complex. Although {HflKC} protein was believed to have a proteolytic activity against lambda {cII} protein, deletion of {hflK-hflC} did not stabilize {SecY.} Instead, the mutant alleles were partially dominant and overexpression of {ftsH} suppressed the mutational effects, suggesting that the mutant proteins antagonized the degradation of {SecY.} These results raise the possibility that even the wild-type {HflKC} protein acts to antagonize {FtsH.} Consistent with this notion, the {hflkC} null mutation accelerated degradation of the {SecY24} protein. Furthermore cross-linking, co-immunoprecipitation, histidine-tagging and gel filtration experiments all indicated that {FtsH} and {HflKC} form a complex in vivo and in vitro. Finally, purified {HflKC} protein inhibited the {SecY-degrading} activity of purified {FtsH} protein in vitro. These results indicate that the proteolytic activity of {FtsH} is modulated negatively by its association with {HflKC.}},

The function of the C-terminal domain of the mammalian {MFE-2}, which shows similarity with sterol carrier protein type 2 ({SCP-2)}, is unclear. Here, the structure of the {SCP-2-like} domain comprising amino acid residues 618-736 of human {MFE-2} (d Delta h Delta {SCP-2L)} was solved at 1.75 A resolution in complex with Triton X-100, an analog of a lipid molecule. This is the first reported structure of an {MFE-2} domain. The d Delta h Delta {SCP-2L} has an alpha/beta-fold consisting of five beta-strands and five alpha-helices; the overall architecture resembles the rabbit and human {SCP-2} structures. However, the structure of d Delta h Delta {SCP-2L} shows a hydrophobic tunnel that traverses the protein, which is occupied by an ordered Triton X-100 molecule. The tunnel is large enough to accommodate molecules such as straight-chain and branched-chain fatty acyl-{CoAs} and bile acid intermediates. Large empty apolar cavities are observed near the exit of the tunnel and between the helices C and D. In addition, the C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal is ordered in the structure and solvent-exposed, which is not the case with unliganded rabbit {SCP-2}, supporting the hypothesis of a ligand-assisted targeting mechanism.},

	volume = {100},
	lccn = {0007},
	abstract = {Of the eight bear species currently existing in the world, four are   found in India: brown bear Ursus arctos isabellinus, Asiatic black bear   U. thibetanus, sun bear Helarctos malayanus and sloth bear Melursus   ursinus. The abundance of each species in India is determined by habitat   type, its location within the global distributional range of the   species, its biology, the quantum and continuity of habitat available,   and the anthropogenic pressures it faces. All species are in Schedule-I   of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, the highest legal   protection status. India marks the southeastern end of the brown bear's   distribution range; the black bear in India occupies a large portion of   the southwestern part of the species' range, sun bear the western end,   and sloth bear most of the species' range. Populations at the periphery   of the range of the species are usually more exposed to pressures, and   have greater chances of going extinct. The habitat available to the   largely herbivorous, hibernation-dependent brown bear in the Trans- and   Greater Himalaya is probably limited to c. 10,000 sq. km, and is   disturbed by anthropogenic pressures such as grazing and medicinal plant   collection. There are about 23 protected areas in the range of the brown   bear, within which there are around 300 animals. The omnivorous black   bear has a vast forested habitat in the Outer and Greater Himalaya and   northeastern India (c. 300,000 sq. km), with at least 56 protected areas   and a minimum of 3,000 animals. Black bears in the higher reaches of the   Greater Himalayan ranges hibernate, while those in the Outer Himalaya   and northeastern India, where they range as low as 500 m, do not.   Although disturbed, black bear habitat in the Himalaya is still   continuous and productive as a result of orchards and croplands.   Poaching for gall bladder, fat, meat and skin is a threat to the   species. The sun bear is extremely rare in India, and is confined to the   forests along the Myanmar border. Hunting, shifting cultivation and   capture of young for trade, after killing the mother, are the threats   across the species' range. The myrmecophagous sloth bear still has a   vast habitat (250,000 sq. km), harbouring a minimum of 10,000 bears. Yet   it is threatened by habitat degradation and fragmentation, poaching for   gall bladder, and capture of young to be trained as performing bears.   Long-term conservation of the brown bear in the Himalaya is possible   only with: (i) cessation of hostilities between India and Pakistan,   leading to the formation of a Transfrontier Reserve protecting the bear   habitat, (ii) a total ban on the capture of young for bear baiting with   dogs, and (iii) ensuring that the protected areas are not unduly   disturbed between May and October. Protection against poaching and   capture of cubs is a must for the conservation of the black bear and the   sloth bear. Weaning the people in the former range of the sun bear from   shifting cultivation, and protection from poaching, may revive the   habitat and population of the sun bear.},

C. elegans was unable to remove a 4 alpha-methyl group or introduce a double bond at C-5 and also demonstrated the lack of a delta 7-reductase. Its nutritional sterol requirement was satisfied by cholestanol, lathosterol or 7-dehydrocholesterol; growth was comparable to that obtained previously in media containing delta 5-sterols.

Signal transduction at the slit diaphragm is essential for the proper function of the kidney filtration barrier. The slit diaphragm constitutes a dynamic multiprotein signaling complex that contains structural proteins, receptors, signaling adaptors, ion channels, and scaffolding proteins. Function of some of these proteins requires cholesterol attached to the multiprotein complex. Recruitment of cholesterol is achieved through the {PHB} domain protein podocin, a member of a novel family of lipid-binding proteins that are conserved through evolution.

	abstract = {Most scientists conduct analyses and run models in several different software and hardware environments, mentally coordinating the export and import of data from one environment to another. The Kepler scientific workflow system provides domain scientists with an easy-to-use yet powerful system for capturing scientific workflows ({SWFs).} {SWFs} are a formalization of the ad-hoc process that a scientist may go through to get from raw data to publishable results. Kepler attempts to streamline the workflow creation and execution process so that scientists can design, execute, monitor, re-run, and communicate analytical procedures repeatedly with minimal effort. Kepler is unique in that it seamlessly combines high-level workflow design with execution and runtime interaction, access to local and remote data, and local and remote service invocation. {SWFs} are superficially similar to business process workflows but have several challenges not present in the business workflow scenario. For example, they often operate on large, complex and heterogeneous data, can be computationally intensive and produce complex derived data products that may be archived for use in reparameterized runs or other workflows. Moreover, unlike business workflows, {SWFs} are often dataflow-oriented as witnessed by a number of recent academic systems (e.g., {DiscoveryNet}, Taverna and Triana) and commercial systems ({Scitegic/Pipeline-Pilot}, Inforsense). In a sense, {SWFs} are often closer to signal-processing and data streaming applications than they are to control-oriented business workflow applications.},

	abstract = {Though sex differences in animal behavior are ubiquitous, their neural and genetic underpinnings remain poorly understood. In particular, the role of functional differences in the neural circuitry that is shared by both sexes has not been extensively investigated. We have addressed these issues with C. elegans olfaction, a simple innate behavior mediated by sexually isomorphic neurons. Though males respond to the same olfactory attractants as do hermaphrodites, we find that each sex has a characteristic repertoire of olfactory preferences. These are not secondary to other sex-specific behaviors and do not require signaling from the gonad. Sex-specific olfactory preferences are controlled by tra-1, the master regulator of C. elegans sexual differentiation. Moreover, the genetic masculinization of neurons in an otherwise wild-type hermaphrodite is sufficient to switch the sexual phenotype of olfactory preference behavior. These studies reveal novel and unexpected sex differences in a C. elegans sensory behavior that is exhibited by both sexes. Our results indicate that these differences are a function of the chromosomally determined sexual identity of shared neural circuitry.},

	abstract = {The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has a finite replicative life span. Yeasts possess two prohibitins, Phb1p and Phb2p, in similarity to mammalian cells. These proteins are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where they are involved in the processing of newly-synthesized membrane proteins. We demonstrate that the elimination of one or both of the prohibitin genes in yeast markedly diminished the replicative life span of cells that lack fully-functional mitochondria, while having no effect on cells with functioning mitochondria. This deleterious effect was suppressed by the deletion of the {RAS2} gene. The expression of {PHB1} and {PHB2} declined gradually up to 5-fold during the life span. Cells in which {PHB1} was deleted in conjunction with the absence of a mitochondrial genome displayed remarkable changes in mitochondrial morphology, distribution, and inheritance. This loss of mitochondrial integrity was not seen in cells devoid of {PHB1} but possessing an intact mitochondrial genome. In a subset of the cells, the changes in mitochondrial integrity were associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species, which co-localized with the altered mitochondria. The mitochondrial deficits described above were all suppressed by deletion of {RAS2.} Our data, together with published information, are interpreted to provide a unified view of the role of the prohibitins in yeast aging. This model posits that the key initiating event is a decline in mitochondrial function, which leads to progressive oxidative damage that is exacerbated in the absence of the prohibitins. This aggravation of the initial damage is ameliorated by the suppression of the production of mitochondrial proteins in the absence of Ras2p signaling of mitochondrial biogenesis.},

Subsequently, they were independently identified as markers of lipid rafts in flotation assays and were hence named flotillins. Since then, reggie/flotillin proteins have been found to be evolutionarily conserved and are present in all vertebrate cells - yet their function has remained elusive and controversial. Recent results now show that reggie/flotillin proteins are indeed necessary for axon regeneration and growth: no axons form when reggies/flotillins are downregulated and signaling pathways controlling actin dynamics are perturbed. Their widespread expression and conservation, however, suggest that these proteins regulate basic cellular functions beyond regeneration. It is argued here that the reggie/flotillin proteins regulate processes vital to all cells - the targeted delivery of bulk membrane and specific membrane proteins from internal vesicle pools to strategically important sites including cell contact sites, the T cell cap, regenerating axons and growth cones and other protrusions.},

	abstract = {The transient receptor potential proteins ({TRPs)} make up a very important family of ion channels responsible for a wide array of cellular functions. Originally identified in the visual system of Drosophila melanogaster, these channels are ubiquitously distributed throughout the mammalian system. The {TRP} family is divided into seven subfamilies in two groups: the first group comprises {TRPC} (canonical), {TRPV} (vanilloid), {TRPM} (melastatin), {TRPN} (Drosophila {NOMPC)} and {TRPA} (ankyrin). The second group contains {TRPML} (mucolipin) and {TRPP} (polycystin). The biophysical characterization of {TRPs} has revealed significantly different activation mechanisms and selectivity between channels. Functional studies have demonstrated that {TRPs} are necessary for a number of physiological processes, including sensation (such as taste, smell and temperature), hormone secretion and development. {TRPs} mediate these effects mainly by controlling the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, which acts as a second messenger. Recent research has linked {TRPs} to different diseases. This review considers the impact of {TRPs} on cell physiology and the abnormalities observed with channel dysfunction.},

	abstract = {The periplasmic domains of the Escherichia coli {HflK} and {HflC} were coexpressed and purified. The two polypeptides copurified in a 1:1 ratio, as determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Circular dichroism studies showed the complex to have substantial helical/coiled-coil content that melted with midpoints in the range of 26-29 degrees C depending upon the concentration, implying a reversible oligomerization. The average molecular weight of the soluble {HflKC} determined by sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation using a single-species model varied with rotor speed, providing further evidence of concentration-dependent oligomerization. The data were well-fit by models that specified a protomer to n-mer oligomerization, with the heterodimeric {HflKC} as the protomer and values of n between 7 and 10. Multiple-sequence alignments of both {HflK} and {HflC} revealed regions near the C termini to contain 11-residue hendecad repeats, indicative of right-handed coiled coils, with characteristic small residues in the a, f, h, and j positions. To test the importance of the small size of these positions, two residues in the {HflC} domain, Ala-262 in a f position and Gly-268 in an a position, were mutated to isoleucine. The {HflKC:A262I} mutant complex showed lower helicity than the wild type, and its melting was less concentration-dependent. During purification of {HflKC:G268I}, the mutated {HflC} subunit precipitated, leaving a preparation of the pure peripheral {HflK} domain. This polypeptide behaved as a monomer in sedimentation equilibrium experiments and showed low helicity, implying that the protein conformation is largely dependent upon heteromeric subunit interactions. These results demonstrate the importance of right-handed coiled-coil interactions in the oligomerization of {HflKC}, and a model entailing the formation of a right-handed helical barrel is proposed.},

For this, we uploaded 6 documents to an institutional web domain that were authored by a fictitious researcher and referenced all the publications of the members of the {EC3} research group at the University of Granada. The detection by Google Scholar of these papers caused an outburst in the number of citations included in the Google Scholar Citations profiles of the authors.

The precise role of band 7.2b is unknown, but it may interact with other proteins of the junctional complex of the membrane skeleton. To gain additional insight into the structure and function of this protein and to provide the necessary tools for further genetic studies of hydrocytosis patients, we determined the sequence of the full-length human band 7.2b {cDNA}, characterized the genomic structure of the band 7.2b gene, studied its pattern of expression in different tissues, and characterized the promoter of the gene. The composite band 7.2b gene {cDNA} was 3047 base pairs in length. Northern blot analysis revealed a wide tissue distribution of expression of the band 7.2b gene, with utilization of alternative polyadenylation signals generating transcripts of 2.2 and 3.1 kilobases. Cloning of the band 7.2b chromosomal gene revealed that it is composed of seven exons distributed over 40 kilobases of {DNA.} The band 7.2b gene promoter was identified as a {TATA-less}, ({G+C)-rich} promoter with a typical {InR} recognition sequence and a single transcription initiation site. It directed high level expression of a reporter gene in both erythroid and nonerythroid cells. An imperfect simple sequence repeat polymorphism was identified in the 5'-flanking {DNA}, and an assay was developed for its analysis by {PCR.}},

	abstract = {Dehydroergosterol [ergosta-5,7,9(11),22-tetraen-3beta-ol] is a naturally-occurring, fluorescent sterol utilized extensively to probe membrane cholesterol distribution, cholesterol-protein interactions, and intracellular cholesterol transport both in vitro and in vivo. In aqueous solutions, the low solubility of dehydroergosterol results in the formation of monohydrate crystals similar to cholesterol. Low temperature X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that dehydroergosterol monohydrate crystallizes in the space group P2(1) with four molecules in the unit cell and monoclinic crystal parameters a = 9.975(1) A, b = 7.4731(9) A, c = 34.054(4) A, and beta = 92.970(2) degrees somewhat similar to ergosterol monohydrate. The molecular arrangement is in a slightly closer packed bilayer structure resembling cholesterol monohydrate. Since dehydroergosterol fluorescence emission undergoes a quantum yield enhancement and red-shift of its maximum wavelength when crystallized, formation or disruption of microcrystals was monitored with high sensitivity using cuvette-based spectroscopy and multi-photon laser scanning imaging microscopy. This manuscript reports on the dynamical effect of sterol carrier protein-2 ({SCP-2)} interacting between aqueous dispersions of dehydroergosterol monohydrate microcrystal donors and acceptors consisting not only of model membranes but also vesicles derived from plasma membranes isolated by biochemical fractionation and affinity purification from Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Furthermore, this study provides real-time measurements of the effect of increased {SCP-2} levels on the rate of disappearance of dehydroergosterol microcrystals in living cells.},

	abstract = {The mitochondrial prohibitin complex consists of two subunits ({PHB1} of 32 {kD} and {PHB2} of 34 {kD)}, assembled into a membrane-associated supercomplex of approximately 1 {MD.} A chaperone-like function in holding and assembling newly synthesized mitochondrial polypeptide chains has been proposed. To further elucidate the function of this complex, structural information is necessary. In this study we use chemical crosslinking, connecting lysine side chains, which are well scattered along the sequence. Crosslinked peptides from protease digested prohibitin complexes were identified with mass spectrometry. From these results, spatial restraints for possible protein conformation were obtained. Many interaction sites between {PHB1} and {PHB2} were found, whereas no homodimeric interactions were observed. Secondary and tertiary structural predictions were made using several algorithms and the models best fitting the spatial restraints were selected for further evaluation. From the structure predictions and the crosslink data we derived a structural building block of one {PHB1} and one {PHB2} subunit, strongly intertwined along most of their length. The size of the complex implies that approximately 14 of these building blocks are present. Each unit contains a putative transmembrane helix in {PHB2.} Taken together with the unit building block we postulate a circular palisade-like arrangement of the building blocks projecting into the intermembrane space.},

We surveyed game trails using   methodology developed by the Andean Bear Program of the Wildlife   Conservation Society. We searched a total of 14 km along 3 trails and   found 4 trees with claw marks resembling Andean bear activity signs. No   other bear activity signs were found. The type and encounter rate of   activity signs found at Serrania de Pirre indicate either a very   sporadic and brief presence of Andean bears in the area or the absence   of Andean bears and the misidentification of the claw marks as bear   signs. We conclude that there is no resident population of Andean bears   at the Serrania de Pirre and probably at the adjacent southernmost   Serrania de Jingurudo. The only other mountain range biogeographically   related with the Andes with reports of Andean bear presence in Panama is   the northernmost Serrania del Darien. Serrania del Darien should be   surveyed to confirm the status of Andean bears in Panama.},

Further, the adherent complex proteins cadherin and beta-catenin were localized to plasma membrane suggesting stabilized adherent junctions in {PHB} silenced cells.

	note = {The {ICT} revolution of the last decades impacted scientific communication as it has impacted many other forms of communications, changing the way in which articles are delivered and how they can be discovered. However, the impact of {ICT} on the research itself has been much more profound, introducing digital tools to the way in which researchers gather data, perform analyses, and exchange results. This brought new, digital forms of research output, and disseminating those calls for changes deeply impact the core format of the scientific article.  In 2009, Elsevier introduced the {“Article} of the Future” project to define an optimal way for the dissemination of science in the digital age, and in this paper we discuss three of its key dimensions. First we discuss interlinking scientific articles and research data stored with domain-specific data repositories — such interlinking is essential to interpret both article and data efficiently and correctly. We then present easy-to-use {3D} visualization tools embedded in online articles: a key example of how the digital article format adds value to scientific communication and helps readers to better understand research results. The last topic covered in this paper is automatic enrichment of journal articles through text-mining or other methods. Here we share insights from a recent survey on the question: how can we find a balance between creating valuable contextual links, without sacrificing the high-quality, peer-reviewed status of published articles?},

	abstract = {Engineering fluorescent proteins into large genomic clones, contained within {BACs} or fosmid vectors, is a tool to visualize and study spatiotemporal gene expression patterns in transgenic animals. Because these reporters cover large genomic regions, they most likely capture all cis-regulatory information and can therefore be expected to recapitulate all aspects of endogenous gene expression. Inserting tags at the target gene locus contained within genomic clones by homologous recombination ("recombineering") represents the most straightforward method to generate these reporters. In this methodology paper, we describe a simple and robust pipeline for recombineering of fosmids, which we apply to generate reporter constructs in the nematode C. elegans, whose genome is almost entirely covered in an available fosmid library. We have generated a toolkit that allows for insertion of fluorescent proteins ({GFP}, {YFP}, {CFP}, {VENUS}, {mCherry)} and affinity tags at specific target sites within fosmid clones in a virtually seamless manner. Our new pipeline is less complex and, in our hands, works more robustly than previously described recombineering strategies to generate reporter fusions for C. elegans expression studies. Furthermore, our toolkit provides a novel recombineering cassette which inserts a {SL2-spliced} intercistronic region between the gene of interest and the fluorescent protein, thus creating a reporter controlled by all 5' and 3' cis-acting regulatory elements of the examined gene without the direct translational fusion between the two. With this configuration, the onset of expression and tissue specificity of secreted, sub-cellular compartmentalized or short-lived gene products can be easily detected. We describe other applications of fosmid recombineering as well. The simplicity, speed and robustness of the recombineering pipeline described here should prompt the routine use of this strategy for expression studies in C. elegans.},

We therefore sought to combine digital photogrammetry with {CAD/CAM} techniques to develop collagen type I hydrogel scaffolds and their respective molds that would precisely mimic the normal anatomy of the patient-specific external ear as well as recapitulate the complex biomechanical properties of native auricular elastic cartilage while avoiding the morbidity of traditional autologous {reconstructions.MethodsThree-dimensional} structures of normal pediatric ears were digitized and converted to virtual solids for mold design. Image-based synthetic reconstructions of these ears were fabricated from collagen type I hydrogels. Half were seeded with bovine auricular chondrocytes. Cellular and acellular constructs were implanted subcutaneously in the dorsa of nude rats and harvested after 1 and 3 {months.ResultsGross} inspection revealed that acellular implants had significantly decreased in size by 1 month. Cellular constructs retained their contour/projection from the animals' dorsa, even after 3 months. Post-harvest weight of cellular constructs was significantly greater than that of acellular constructs after 1 and 3 months. Safranin O-staining revealed that cellular constructs demonstrated evidence of a self-assembled perichondrial layer and copious neocartilage deposition. Verhoeff staining of 1 month cellular constructs revealed de novo elastic cartilage deposition, which was even more extensive and robust after 3 months. The equilibrium modulus and hydraulic permeability of cellular constructs were not significantly different from native bovine auricular cartilage after 3 {months.ConclusionsWe} have developed high-fidelity, biocompatible, patient-specific tissue-engineered constructs for auricular reconstruction which largely mimic the native auricle both biomechanically and histologically, even after an extended period of implantation. This strategy holds immense potential for durable patient-specific tissue-engineered anatomically proper auricular reconstructions in the future.},

	abstract = {In Caenorhabditis elegans necrosis-like neuronal death is induced by gain-of-function (gf) mutations in two genes, mec-4 and deg-1, that encode proteins similar to subunits of the vertebrate amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel. We have determined the progress of cellular pathology in dying neurons via light and electron microscopy. The first detectable abnormality is an infolding of the plasma membrane and the production of small electron-dense whorls. Later, cytoplasmic vacuoles and larger membranous whorls form, and the cell swells. More slowly, chromatin aggregates and the nucleus invaginates. Mitochondria and Golgi are not dramatically affected until the final stages of cell death when organelles, and sometimes the cells themselves, lyse. Certain cells, including some muscle cells in deg-1 animals, express the abnormal gene products and display a few membrane abnormalities but do not die. These cells either express the mutant genes at lower levels, lack other proteins needed to form inappropriately functioning channels, or are better able to compensate for the toxic effects of the channels. Overall, the ultrastructural changes in these deaths suggest that enhanced membrane cycling precedes vacuolation and cell swelling. The pathology of mec-4(gf) and deg-1(gf) cells shares features with that of genetic disorders with alterations in channel subunits, such as hypokalemic periodic paralysis in humans and the weaver mouse, and with degenerative conditions, e.g., acute excitotoxic death. The initial pathology in all of these conditions may reflect attempts by affected cells to compensate for abnormal membrane proteins or functions.},

Twenty-seven mutations occurred spontaneously in strains with a high frequency of transposon insertion. Sixty-eight were isolated after treatment with {EMS.} All of the mutations result in defects in one or more chemosensory responses, such as chemotaxis to ammonium chloride or formation of dauer larvae under conditions of starvation and overcrowding. Seventy-five of the mutations are alleles of 12 previously defined genes, mutations which were previously shown to lead to defects in amphid ultrastructure. We have assigned 20 mutations to 13 new genes, called dyf-1 through dyf-13. We expect that the genes represented by dye-filing defective mutants are important for the differentiation of amphid and phasmid chemosensilla.},

The presence of bears in western Bengal and from   Madhupur Gar, the Garo hills of the Greater Mymenshing district, and   Rangpur and Pabna districts was reported beginning in the late 18th   century by several researchers (Buchanan 1833; Hunter 1876; Vas 1911;   Strong 1912; Khan, 1990). However, bears were extirpated there due to   habitat destruction caused by the expansion of human settlement and   agricultural land at the beginning of 19th century. Threats to bear   populations are still increasing because of the expansion of human   populations, and resultant over-exploitation of bear habitat and of   bears themselves. However, little study has been done so far on any bear   species in Bangladesh. In this report, I summarize information from my   own research since 1970, extensive interviews with local people, and the   literature. I expect this report to promote further research and   conservation activities in Bangladesh.},

	abstract = {{E2F} transcription factors play a major role in controlling mammalian cell cycle progression. We recently reported that a potential tumor suppressor, prohibitin, which interacts with retinoblastoma protein (Rb), regulates {E2F} function and this activity correlates with its growth-suppressive activity. We show here that prohibitin recruits Brg-{1/Brm} to {E2F-responsive} promoters, and that this recruitment is required for the repression of {E2F-mediated} transcription by prohibitin. Expression of a dominant-negative Brg-1 or Brm releases prohibitin-mediated repression of {E2F} and relieves prohibitin-mediated growth suppression. Although prohibitin associates with, and recruits, Brg-1 and Brm independently of Rb, {prohibitin/Brg-1/Brm-mediated} transcriptional repression requires Rb. A viral oncoprotein, {SV40} large T antigen, can reverse prohibitin-mediated suppression of {E2F-mediated} gene transcription, and targets prohibitin through interruption of the association between prohibitin and Brg-{1/Brm} without affecting the prohibitin-{E2F} interaction.},

In this study, we show that {SLP-2} is strongly associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane and that it interacts with prohibitins. Depleting {HeLa} cells of {SLP-2} lead to increased proteolysis of prohibitins and of subunits of the respiratory chain complexes I and {IV.} Further supporting the role of {SLP-2} in regulating the stability of specific mitochondrial proteins, we found that {SLP-2} is up-regulated under conditions of mitochondrial stress leading to increased protein turnover.

In this study, using the data of two comprehensive evaluation studies on the {CPR} process at Angewandte {Chemie—International} Edition and the {PPR} process at Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, we examined the language characteristics in comments that were written by invited reviewers in {CPR} and by invited reviewers and interested members of the scientific community in {PPR.} We used Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count ({LIWC)}, a text analysis software program that counts words in meaningful categories (e.g., positive or negative emotions) using a standardized dictionary. We examined 599 comments from the reviews of 229 manuscripts. The results show that the comments in {PPR} are much longer than the comments in {CPR.} This is an indication that {PPR} reviewing has more of an improvement function and {CPR} reviewing has more of a selection function. The results also show that {CPR} is not, as might be expected, more susceptible to the expression of negative emotions than {PPR} is. On the contrary, positive emotion words are used statistically significantly more frequently in {CPR} than in {PPR.}},

This paper examines an equally daunting challenge – the diversity of interdisciplinary data, notably research data, and the need to interrelate these data to understand complex systemic problems such as environmental change and its impact. We use the experience of the International Polar Year 2007–8 ({IPY)} as a case study to examine data management approaches seeking to address issues around complex interdisciplinary science. We find that, while technology is a critical factor in addressing the interdisciplinary dimension of the data intensive science, the technologies developing for exa-scale data volumes differ from those that are needed for extremely distributed and heterogeneous data. Research data will continue to be highly heterogeneous and distributed and will require technologies to be much simpler and more flexible. More importantly, there is a need for both technical and cultural adaptation. We describe a vision of discoverable, open, linked, useful, and safe collections of data, organized and curated using the best principles and practices of information and library science. This vision provides a framework for our discussion and leads us to suggest several short- and long-term strategies to facilitate a socio-technical evolution in the overall science data ecosystem.},

	abstract = {{NPHS2} was recently identified as a gene whose mutations cause autosomal recessive steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Its product, podocin, is a new member of the stomatin family, which consists of hairpin-like integral membrane proteins with intracellular {NH(2)-} and {COOH-termini.} Podocin is expressed in glomerular podocytes, but its subcellular distribution and interaction with other proteins are unknown. Here we show, by immunoelectron microscopy, that podocin localizes to the podocyte foot process membrane, at the insertion site of the slit diaphragm. Podocin accumulates in an oligomeric form in lipid rafts of the slit diaphragm. Moreover, {GST} pull-down experiments reveal that podocin associates via its {COOH-terminal} domain with {CD2AP}, a cytoplasmic binding partner of nephrin, and with nephrin itself. That podocin interacts with {CD2AP} and nephrin in vivo is shown by coimmunoprecipitation of these proteins from glomerular extracts. Furthermore, in vitro studies reveal direct interaction of podocin and {CD2AP.} Hence, as with the erythrocyte lipid raft protein stomatin, podocin is present in high-order oligomers and may serve a scaffolding function. We postulate that podocin serves in the structural organization of the slit diaphragm and the regulation of its filtration function.},

Studies in C. elegans have shown this system is mediated by seven smg genes and can prevent the accumulation of toxic, truncated peptides. Here we report the cloning of smg-4 by physical mapping and functional rescue assays. The minimal rescuing activity is found within a genomic operon, encoding a novel protein. The final exon of the gene is alternatively spliced for expression of two different isoforms. Although no known genes were found to exhibit significant homology to smg-4, a novel conserved domain has been identified by alignment with sequences defined by expressed sequence tags ({ESTs)} from a variety of organisms. Furthermore, we describe a homolog from C. briggsae, which will rescue C. elegans smg-4 mutants. The C. elegans gene has been fused to green fluorescent protein ({GFP).} This {SMG-4:GFP} fusion exhibits nuclear accumulation and diffuse cytoplasmic staining, and further localizes to what appear to be perinuclear and cytoplasmic punctate structures.},

Cross-hybridizing sequences are detectable in other species, raising the possibility that degenerative conditions in other organisms may be caused by mutations in similar genes.

We demonstrated that failure to incorporate detection probability in distribution survey methods underestimated habitat occupancy for all species.4. Protected areas were important for the distribution of 16 species. However, for many species much of their current range remains unprotected. The availability of evergreen forests was important for the occurrence of 14 species, temperate forests for six species, deciduous forests for 15 species and higher altitude habitats for two species. Low human population density was critical for the occurrence of five species, while culturally based tolerance was important for the occurrence of nine other species.5. Rhino Rhinoceros unicornis, gaur Bos gaurus and elephant Elephas maximus showed the most restricted ranges among herbivores, and sun bear Helarctos malayanus, brown bear Ursus arctos and tiger Panthera tigris were most restricted among carnivores. While cultural tolerance has helped the survival of some mammals, legal protection has been critically associated with occurrence of most species.6. Synthesis and applications. Extent of range is an important determinant of species conservation status. Understanding the relationship of species occurrence with ecological and socio-cultural covariates is important for identification and management of key conservation areas. The combination of occupancy models with field data from country-wide experts enables reliable estimation of species range and habitat associations for conservation at regional scales.},

	abstract = {Computer networks open new possibilities for scientific communication in terms of quality, efficiency, and rapidity. Consensus journals have the economy of invitational journals and the objectivity of journals based upon peer review. That is, all articles are published and the reader benefits from article selection based upon impartial refereeing. An additional benefit of consensus journals is that the negotiation process, which typically occurs prior to publication, is automated, thus saving efforts of participants. Readers submit reviews that evaluate articles on agreed dimensions. A statistical procedure is used to identify the most knowledgeable representative of each consensus position, and these persons are invited to submit articles that justify the review judgments they have submitted. A major advantage of this approach is the ability to develop reputation without article publication. The approach includes a protection mechanism based upon pseudonyms, which substitutes for the protection of anonymity typical of scientific journals. This reduces the potential for irresponsible behavior and facilitates reputation development. The level of quality enhancement is superior to that achievable with anonymous peer review. Eliminating the editor and the delay associated with conventional refereeing makes message quality enhancement available in message systems for educational and business environments.},

	abstract = {Our laboratory was interested in characterizing the molecular composition of non-caveolar lipid rafts. Thus, we generated monoclonal antibodies to lipid raft proteins of human myelomonocytic cells. Two of these proteins, {KE04p} and C8orf2, were found to be highly enriched in the detergent-insoluble, buoyant fraction of sucrose gradients in a cholesterol-dependent manner. They contain an evolutionarily conserved domain placing them in the prohibitin family of proteins. In contrast to other family members, these two proteins localized to the {ER.} Furthermore, the extreme N-termini of {KE04p} and C8orf2 were found to be sufficient for heterologous targeting of {GFP} to the {ER} in the absence of classical {ER} retrieval motifs. We also demonstrate that all prohibitin family members rely on sequences in their extreme N-termini for their distinctive subcellular distributions including the mitochondria, plasma membrane and Golgi vesicles. Owing to their subcellular localization and their presence in lipid rafts, we have named {KE04p} and C8orf2, {ER} lipid raft protein (erlin)-1 and erlin-2, respectively. Interestingly, the {ER} contains relatively low levels of cholesterol and sphingolipids compared with other organelles. Thus, our data support the existence of lipid-raft-like domains within the membranes of the {ER.}},

Of the 33 tumors, 5 were desmoplastic/nodular, 10 were histologically classic, and 18 were large cell/anaplastic. Chromosomal gains and losses were more common in anaplastic medulloblastomas than in non-anaplastic ones. We identified 4 medulloblastomas with c-myc amplification and 5 medulloblastomas with N-myc amplification; all 9 were of the large cell/anaplastic subtype. Additional regions with high level gains included 2q14-22, 3p23, 5p14-pter, 8q24, 9p22-23, 10p12-pter, 12q24, 12p11-12, 17p11-12, and Xp11. The majority of these high level gains occurred in anaplastic cases. We also found loss of chromosome 17p in 7 large cell/anaplastic cases but no non-anaplastic medulloblastomas. Finally, we detected a significantly increased overall number of chromosomal alterations in large cell/anaplastic medulloblastomas (6.8/case) compared to non-anaplastic ones (3.3/case). These findings support an association between myc oncogene amplification, 17p loss, and large cell/anaplastic histology.},

	abstract = {{FtsH} is a membrane-bound and {ATP-dependent} protease of Escherichia coli, known to degrade {SecY}, a membrane protein for protein translocation, and {CII}, a soluble transcription factor for lysis/lysogeny decision of phage lambda. {FtsH} forms a homo-oligomeric complex as well as a hetero-oligomeric complex with {HflKC}, a putative modulator of {FtsH.} Although {FtsH} has a small periplasmic region, {HflKC} is mostly exposed to the periplasmic space. We studied the roles of the periplasmic region of {FtsH} by engineering mutations in this protein. {FtsHDelta236}, lacking most of the periplasmic region, retained the in vivo ability to degrade {SecY} but not {CII}, resulting in high frequency lysogenization of lambda. Several insertion mutations in the periplasmic region of {FtsH} also differentially affected the proteolytic activities of {FtsH.} Interestingly, purified and detergent-solubilized {FtsHDelta236} was as active as the wild-type enzyme in degrading {SecY} and {CII}, although its {ATPase} activity was lowered 5-fold. Affinity chromatography using histidine-tagged derivatives showed that the periplasmic domain-deleted {FtsH} no longer interacted with {FtsH} or {HflKC.} Although {FtsHDelta236-His6-Myc} lost the static {FtsH-FtsH} interaction, it retained the ability to change its conformation in an {ATP-dependent} manner at 37 {degreesC}, leading to a limited oligomerization. These results suggest that the periplasmic region of {FtsH} has crucial roles in the protein-protein interactions of this complex and in the modulation of its proteolytic functions against different substrates.},

Recent findings indicate that the presence of at least one mutant allele within a certain prohibitin gene polymorphism causes inactivation of bioactive {RNA} resulting in the loss of its pro-apoptotic function and a subsequent risk for malignant growth. Based on these findings we studied whether the presence of this prohibitin polymorphism increases the risk and worsens the prognosis of ovarian cancer in Caucasian women. {STUDY} {DESIGN:} A polymorphism within the 3' untranslated region ({UTR)} of the prohibitin gene was evaluated by pyrosequencing in 136 Caucasian patients with epithelial ovarian cancer and 129 healthy Caucasian controls. {RESULTS:} The wild-type {C/C}, heterozygous {C/T}, and the mutant {T/T} prohibitin genotype was found in 88 (64.7\%), 46 (33.8\%), and 2 (1.5\%) patients with ovarian cancer and in 84 (65.1\%), 39 (30.2\%), and 6 (4.7\%) healthy controls. Presence of at least one mutant allele of the prohibitin 3' {UTR} polymorphism was not associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer as compared to healthy controls (P=0.9). No association was found between presence of the prohibitin 3' {UTR} polymorphism and the clinico-pathological parameters tumor stage, tumor grade, and patients' age at diagnosis. Presence of at least one mutant allele of the prohibitin 3' {UTR} polymorphism was not associated with disease-free and overall survival. {CONCLUSION:} The prohibitin 3' {UTR} polymorphism was not associated with risk and prognosis of ovarian cancer in Caucasian women.},

We explain how 3-d figures can be created using the {S2PLOT} graphics library, exported to Product Representation Compact ({PRC)} format, and included as fully interactive, 3-d figures in {PDF} files using the movie15 {LaTeX} package. We present new examples of 3-d {PDF} figures, explain how they have been made, validate them, and comment on their advantages over traditional, static 2-dimensional (2-d) figures. With the judicious use of 3-d rather than 2-d figures, scientists can now publish, share and archive more useful, flexible and faithful representations of their study {outcomes.The} article you are reading does not have embedded 3-d figures. The full paper, with embedded 3-d figures, is recommended and is available as a supplementary download from {PLoS} {ONE} (File S2).},

These cells receive synapses from {AVM} but do not participate in the touch reflex circuit.

	abstract = {We used a functional screening method to isolate genes whose products elicit the hypersensitive response ({HR)} pathway of defense against plant pathogens. A {cDNA} library derived from tobacco leaves undergoing the {HR} was cloned into a tobacco mosaic virus ({TMV)-based} expression vector. Infectious transcripts were generated and used to inoculate tobacco plants lacking the N resistance gene (genotype Xanthi nn). Approximately 1/1000 of the infectious transcripts produced local lesions, and may thus elicit the {HR.} The {cDNA} inserts from 50 lesion-forming clones were recovered by {RT-PCR}, and 12 unique clones were sequenced. Comparisons with protein databases revealed homologies to (a) ubiquitin, (b) tobacco tumor-related protein, similar to Kunitz-type trypsin inhibitors and (c) ribosomal protein S14. The remaining nine clones revealed no homology to known proteins and are thus considered novel. Five clones were able to induce the expression of {PR2}, a gene which is specifically activated in the tobacco {HR.} Northern and western blot analyses of leaves infected by the clone encoding ubiquitin strongly suggest that the infection produced a co-suppression response; the endogenous level of ubiquitin {mRNA} and protein in infected leaves are ca. 50\% less than those found in healthy leaves. This observation supports a previous report on the involvement of the ubiquitin system in the tobacco {HR} [2], and validates and utility of the functional cloning method.},

	abstract = {C. elegans {OSM-9} is a {TRPV} channel protein involved in sensory transduction and adaptation. Here, we show that distinct sensory functions arise from different combinations of {OSM-9} and related {OCR} {TRPV} proteins. Both {OSM-9} and {OCR-2} are essential for several forms of sensory transduction, including olfaction, osmosensation, mechanosensation, and chemosensation. In neurons that express both {OSM-9} and {OCR-2}, tagged {OCR-2} and {OSM-9} proteins reside in sensory cilia and promote each other's localization to cilia. In neurons that express only {OSM-9}, tagged {OSM-9} protein resides in the cell body and acts in sensory adaptation rather than sensory transduction. Thus, alternative combinations of {TRPV} proteins may direct different functions in distinct subcellular locations. Animals expressing the mammalian {TRPV1} ({VR1)} channel in {ASH} nociceptor neurons avoid the {TRPV1} ligand capsaicin, allowing selective, drug-inducible activation of a specific behavior.},

Caspases, the executioners of programmed cell death, are normally synthesized as inactive zymogens and are activated by proteolytic processing of their subunits. We show here, using two different caspases, Caenorhabditis elegans {CED-3} and human Caspase-3, that coexpression of the subunits generates constitutively active caspase activity that leads to cell death. This {recCaspase} activity, however, occurred only when the subunits associated through binding of linked antiparallel leucine-zipper domains. We exploited the dual-component nature of {recCaspases} by expressing the individual subunits from combinations of promoters either to target selectively the subset of cells for apoptosis or induce cell death in specific cells at specific times during development. The high degree of target specificity and tight regulation of induction of {recCaspase} would be advantageous in creating animal models that are ablated for specific cells and in other targeted cell killings.},

However, there are no systematic estimates of how the availability of research data changes with time since publication. We therefore requested data sets from a relatively homogenous set of 516 articles published between 2 and 22 years ago, and found that availability of the data was strongly affected by article age. For papers where the authors gave the status of their data, the odds of a data set being extant fell by 17\% per year. In addition, the odds that we could find a working e-mail address for the first, last, or corresponding author fell by 7\% per year. Our results reinforce the notion that, in the long term, research data cannot be reliably preserved by individual researchers, and further demonstrate the urgent need for policies mandating data sharing via public archives.},

	abstract = {To investigate the behavioral mechanism of chemotaxis in Caenorhabditis elegans, we recorded the instantaneous position, speed, and turning rate of single worms as a function of time during chemotaxis in gradients of the attractants ammonium chloride or biotin. Analysis of turning rate showed that each worm track could be divided into periods of smooth swimming (runs) and periods of frequent turning (pirouettes). The initiation of pirouettes was correlated with the rate of change of concentration ({dC/dt)} but not with absolute concentration. Pirouettes were most likely to occur when a worm was heading down the gradient ({dC/dt} {\textless} 0) and least likely to occur when a worm was heading up the gradient ({dC/dt} {\textgreater} 0). Further analysis revealed that the average direction of movement after a pirouette was up the gradient. These observations suggest that chemotaxis is produced by a series of pirouettes that reorient the animal to the gradient. We tested this idea by imposing the correlation between pirouettes and {dC/dt} on a stochastic point model of worm motion. The model exhibited chemotaxis behavior in a radial gradient and also in a novel planar gradient. Thus, the pirouette model of C. elegans chemotaxis is sufficient and general.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} With its fully sequenced genome and simple, well-defined nervous system, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans offers a unique opportunity to correlate gene expression with neuronal differentiation. The lineal origin, cellular morphology and synaptic connectivity of each of the 302 neurons are known. In many instances, specific behaviors can be attributed to particular neurons or circuits. Here we describe microarray-based methods that monitor gene expression in C. elegans neurons and, thereby, link comprehensive profiles of neuronal transcription to key developmental and functional properties of the nervous system. {RESULTS:} We employed complementary microarray-based strategies to profile gene expression in the embryonic and larval nervous systems. In the {MAPCeL} (Microarray Profiling C. elegans cells) method, we used fluorescence activated cell sorting ({FACS)} to isolate {GFP-tagged} embryonic neurons for microarray analysis. To profile the larval nervous system, we used the {mRNA-tagging} technique in which an epitope-labeled {mRNA} binding protein ({FLAG-PAB-1)} was transgenically expressed in neurons for immunoprecipitation of cell-specific transcripts. These combined approaches identified approximately 2,500 {mRNAs} that are highly enriched in either the embryonic or larval C. elegans nervous system. These data are validated in part by the detection of gene classes (for example, transcription factors, ion channels, synaptic vesicle components) with established roles in neuronal development or function. Of particular interest are 19 conserved transcripts of unknown function that are also expressed in the mammalian brain. In addition to utilizing these profiling approaches to define stage-specific gene expression, we also applied the {mRNA-tagging} method to fingerprint a specific neuron type, the A-class group of cholinergic motor neurons, during early larval development. A comparison of these data to a {MAPCeL} profile of embryonic A-class motor neurons identified genes with common functions in both types of A-class motor neurons as well as transcripts with roles specific to each motor neuron type. {CONCLUSION:} We describe microarray-based strategies for generating expression profiles of embryonic and larval C. elegans neurons. These methods can be applied to particular neurons at specific developmental stages and, therefore, provide an unprecedented opportunity to obtain spatially and temporally defined snapshots of gene expression in a simple model nervous system.},

The effects of ageing in breeders may therefore be moderated by the presence of helpers, but there have been very few studies of senescence patterns in natural populations of cooperative breeders.3. Here, we use 13 years of data from a long-term study population of wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) to investigate age-related changes in several traits known to be key components of reproductive success in females of this species.4. Four of the six traits studied exhibited significant declines with age, indicating senescence. Litter size, the number of litters produced per year and the number of pups that survived to emergence from the natal burrow per year all increased with female age up to a peak at c. 4 years, and declined steeply thereafter; the mean pup weight at emergence in a given litter declined steadily from age zero.5. These results provide the first evidence of reproductive senescence in a wild population of a cooperatively breeding vertebrate. Breeding success declined with age despite the sharing of reproductive costs in this species, but further study is needed to investigate whether helping affects other aspects of senescence, including survival.},

	abstract = {We investigated serotonin signaling in C. elegans as a paradigm for neural regulation of energy balance and found that serotonergic regulation of fat is molecularly distinct from feeding regulation. Serotonergic feeding regulation is mediated by receptors whose functions are not required for fat regulation. Serotonergic fat regulation is dependent on a neurally expressed channel and a G protein-coupled receptor that initiate signaling cascades that ultimately promote lipid breakdown at peripheral sites of fat storage. In turn, intermediates of lipid metabolism generated in the periphery modulate feeding behavior. These findings suggest that, as in mammals, C. elegans feeding behavior is regulated by extrinsic and intrinsic cues. Moreover, obesity and thinness are not solely determined by feeding behavior. Rather, feeding behavior and fat metabolism are coordinated but independent responses of the nervous system to the perception of nutrient availability.},

	abstract = {Animals of many species tend to target their foraging attempts toward particular microhabitats within their habitat. Although these preferences are critical determinants of the foraging niche and have important ecological and evolutionary implications, we know little about how they develop. Here, we use detailed longitudinal data from meerkats (Suricata suricatta) to examine how individual learning and the use of social information affect the development of foraging microhabitat preferences. Despite living in an open, arid environment, adult meerkats frequently foraged at the base of vegetation. Young pups seldom did so, but their foraging microhabitat choices became increasingly adult-like as they grew older. Learning about profitable microhabitats may have been promoted in part by positive reinforcement from prey capture. Foraging may also have become increasingly targeted toward suitable locations as pups grew older because they spent more time searching before embarking on foraging bouts. The development of microhabitat preferences might also have been influenced by social cues. Foraging in close proximity to adults may increase the probability that pups would dig in similar microhabitats. Also, pups often dug in holes created by older individuals, whereas adults never dug in existing holes. Foraging in existing holes was no more profitable to pups than creating their own foraging hole but could provide pups with important informational benefits. The integration of personal and social information is likely to be a common feature in the development of the foraging niche in generalist species.},

Caveolins (Cav-1, -2 and -3) and flotillins ({FLO-1} and {FLO-2} [also known as epidermal surface antigens ({ESAs)]} are two families of mammalian caveolae-associated integral membrane proteins. Although a caveolin gene family has recently been described in the invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans, it remains unknown as to whether flotillin homologues exist in invertebrates. Here, we report the identification, {cDNA} sequence and embryonic expression pattern of the first invertebrate flotillin, i.e. flotillin from Drosophila melanogaster ({FLODm).} {FLODm} is most closely related to mammalian flotillin-1. Remarkably, the invertebrate {FLODm} protein behaves like mammalian flotillins and is targeted to the caveolae-enriched membrane fraction after transient expression in mammalian cells. Localization of the {FLODm} message in D. melanogaster embryos reveals that expression of {FLODm} is confined primarily to the developing nervous system. This is consistent with our previous observation that mammalian flotillin-1 {mRNA} and protein is expressed abundantly in brain tissue. Interestingly, the {FLODm} gene is localized to chromosomal region 52 B1-B2. In addition, we find that at least two flotillin-related genes are expressed in D. melanogaster. Our current results provide a starting point and systematic basis for dissecting the role of flotillin in caveolae and neuronal development using Drosophila as a genetic system.},

Our previous studies characterizing prohibitin in immortalized cells, classified into four complementation groups (A-D) based on the ability of whole-cell hybrids to become senescent, have suggested that it has tumor suppressor activity in group B cells. Only the cell lines assigned to group B are sensitive to the antiproliferative activity of prohibitin, and all are homozygous for an allele designated B because of its exclusive association with this group. Prohibitin genotyping of 22 breast cancer cell lines identified 17 homozygous for the B allele, 5 homozygous for the non-B allele, and no heterozygotes. Four of these cell lines were chosen for further characterization of prohibitin. In cell proliferation assays, the homozygous B breast cancer cell lines ({BT-20}, {SK-BR-3}, and {MCF7)} are all inhibited from traversing the cell cycle following the introduction of wild-type prohibitin transcripts. The cell line homozygous for the alternative non-B allele ({BT-549)} is not inhibited by transcripts. All of the breast cancer cell lines overexpress the longer form of the prohibitin {mRNA} (1.9 kb) and the protein. Mutational analysis of the protein-coding region detected no mutations in any of the lines. However, {BT-20}, {SK-BR-3}, and {MCF7} cells are all mutated in the final 200 bases of the 3' untranslated region ({3'UTR)} exclusive to the 1.9-kb transcript, but {BT-549} cells had no alterations in this region of the {3'UTR.} Functional mapping experiments performed in the mutated {SK-BR-3} line showed that the wild-type {3'UTR} alone is sufficient to inhibit cell cycle progression, indicating that the antiproliferative activity of the prohibitin transcript is localized to this region. Overall, our results show that most (80\%) of the cell lines derived from breast tumors have a common prohibitin genotype, suggesting that they belong to the same group of immortalized cells, group B. The results also show that the prohibitin {3'UTR} exhibits the characteristics of a trans-acting regulatory {RNA} (riboregulator), the tumor suppressor activity of which is inactivated by mutation in group B immortalized cells.},

	abstract = {Acid-sensing ion channels ({ASICs)} are H(+)-gated members of the degenerin/epithelial Na(+) channel ({DEG/ENaC)} family in vertebrate neurons. Several {ASICs} are expressed in sensory neurons, where they play a role in responses to nociceptive, taste, and mechanical stimuli; others are expressed in central neurons, where they participate in synaptic plasticity and some forms of learning. Stomatin is an integral membrane protein found in lipid/protein-rich microdomains, and it is believed to regulate the function of ion channels and transporters. In Caenorhabditis elegans, stomatin homologs interact with {DEG/ENaC} channels, which together are necessary for normal mechanosensation in the worm. Therefore, we asked whether stomatin interacts with and modulates the function of {ASICs.} We found that stomatin co-immunoprecipitated and co-localized with {ASIC} proteins in heterologous cells. Moreover, stomatin altered the function of {ASIC} channels. Stomatin potently reduced acid-evoked currents generated by {ASIC3} without changing steady state protein levels or the amount of {ASIC3} expressed at the cell surface. In contrast, stomatin accelerated the desensitization rate of {ASIC2} and heteromeric {ASICs}, whereas current amplitude was unaffected. These data suggest that stomatin binds to and alters the gating of {ASICs.} Our findings indicate that modulation of {DEG/ENaC} channels by stomatin-like proteins is evolutionarily conserved and may have important implications for mammalian nociception and mechanosensation.},

	abstract = {Caenorhabditis elegans requires sterol, usually supplied as cholesterol, but this is enzymatically modified, and different sterols can substitute. Sterol deprivation decreased brood size and adult growth in the first generation, and completely, reversibly, arrested growth as larvae in the second. After one generation of sterol deprivation, 10 ng/ml cholesterol allowed delayed laying of a few eggs, but full growth required 300 ng/ml. C. elegans synthesizes two unusual 4alpha-methyl sterols ({4MSs)}, but each {4MS} supported only limited growth as the sole sterol. However, addition of only 10 ng of cholesterol to 1,000 ng of {4MS} restored full growth and egg-laying, suggesting that both a {4MS} and an unmethylated sterol are required for development. Filipin stained sterols in only a few specific cells: the excretory gland cell, two amphid socket cells, two phasmid socket cells and, in males, spicule socket cells. Sterols were also present in the pharynx and in the intestine of feeding animals in a proximal-to-distal gradient. This non-random sterol distribution, the low concentration requirements, and the effects of {4MSs} argues that sterols are unlikely to be used for bulk structural modification of cell membranes, but may be required as hormone precursors and/or developmental effectors.},

However, quantifying lifetime growth is essential for understanding trade-offs between growth and other life history parameters, such as reproductive performance or survival. Here, we used model selection based on information theory to measure changes in body mass over the lifespan of wild meerkats, and compared the relative fits of several standard growth models (monomolecular, von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, logistic and Richards). We found that meerkats exhibit monomolecular growth, with the best model incorporating separate growth rates before and after nutritional independence, as well as effects of season and total rainfall in the previous nine months. Our study demonstrates how simple growth curves may be improved by considering life history and environmental factors, which may be particularly relevant when quantifying growth patterns in wild populations.},

There are 58 neurons in the tip of the head. Fifty-two of these are arranged in sensilla. These include six inner labial sensilla, six outer labial sensilla, four cephalic sensilla and two amphids. Each sensillum consists of ciliated sensory neurons ending in a channel enclosed by two non-neuronal cells, the sheath and socket cells. The amphidial channel opens to the outside as does that of the inner labial sensilla so that these probably contain chemoreceptive neurons. The endings of the other sensilla are embedded in the cuticle and may be mechanoreceptive. The cell bodies of all the neurons lie near the nerve ring and their axons project into the ring or into ventral ganglia. One of the ciliated sensory neurons in each of the six inner labial sensilla makes direct chemical synapses onto a muscle making these sensory-motor neurons. The anatomy of four isogenic animals was compared in detail and found to be largely invariant. The anatomy of juveniles is nearly identical to that of the adult, but males have four additional neuron processes.},

In humans stomatin is missing from erythrocyte membranes in the hemolytic disease overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, despite an apparently normal stomatin gene. Overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis is characterized by alteration of the normal transmembrane gradients of sodium and potassium. Stomatin has been shown to interact genetically with sodium channels. It is also postulated that stomatin is important in the organization of lipid rafts. We demonstrate here that antibodies against {UNC-1} stain the major nerve tracts of Caenorhabditis elegans, with very intense staining of the nerve ring. We also found that a gene encoding a stomatin-like protein, {UNC-24}, affects anesthetic sensitivity and is genetically epistatic to unc-1. In the absence of {UNC-24}, the staining of the nerve ring by anti-{UNC-1} is abolished, despite normal transcriptional levels of the unc-1 {mRNA.} Western blots indicate that {UNC-24} probably affects the stability of the {UNC-1} protein. {UNC-24} may therefore be necessary for the correct placement of {UNC-1} in the cell membrane and organization of lipid rafts.},

In this article, which precedes the Chavan and Penev article by two years, the authors establish a data publishing framework that would set the stage for incentivizing individuals and institutions to publish their research data. Later, in Chavan and Penev, the authors propose a method by which scientists could publish their research data, called the “data paper,” which fits within these frameworks. In this article, the authors assert that “[o]pen access to primary biodiversity data is essential both to enable effective decision-making and to empower those concerned with the conservation of biodiversity and the natural world.“
The authors lay out several challenges to publishing of data sets and propose the {“Data} Publishing Frameworks” to help alleviate some of these roadblocks. The roadblocks are 1. possible misuse of data, albeit inadvertently, 2. Lack of ownership agreements, 3. Academic tenure and promotion considerations, 4. Funding competition, 5. Usability issues, and 6. Lack of confidentiality. The Data Publishing Frameworks consists of five areas to address: technical and infrastructure, policy and political, socio-cultural, economic, and legal. This article proceeds to elaborate on the parts of the technical and infrastructure area: persistent identifiers, data usage index, and data citation. The data usage index is proposed as a method to demonstrate impact of data sets by providing statistics such as unique visits, loyal visits (more than one visit from one {IP} address), viewing of data sets, download of data sets, and volume distributions of data sets.
While the authors did a good job of explaining the need for the technical and infrastructural components, as well as what they are and how they work, they did not dive into the other four areas that proposed Data Publishing Frameworks contain. However, upon future searching, I discovered an article entitled, {“Towards} Mainstreaming of Biodiversity Data Publishing: Recommendations of the {GBIF} Data Publishing Framework Task Group,” which was published in 2011. This article dives deeper into the Data Publishing Frameworks and provides specific recommendations to address each of the five parts of the frameworks.

They need to be advanced by interactive and transparent forms of review, publication and discussion that are open to the scientific community and to the public. The advantages of open access, public peer review and interactive discussion can be efficiently and flexibly combined with the strengths of traditional publishing and peer review. Since 2001 the viability of this approach is demonstrated by the highly successful interactive open access journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics ({ACP)} and a growing number of sister journals of the European Geosciences Union ({EGU)} and Copernicus Publications. The achievements and statistics of these journals and their publishers clearly prove both the scientific benefits and the financial sustainability of open access. Future perspectives are outlined with regard to critical rationalism, open societies and the global information commons.},

	abstract = {Integrity critical databases, such as financial information used in high-value decisions, are frequently published over the Internet. Publishers of such data must satisfy the integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation requirements of clients. Providing this protection over public data networks is an expensive proposition. This is, in part, due to the difficulty of building and running secure systems. In practice, large systems can not be verified to be secure and are frequently penetrated. The negative consequences of a system intrusion at the publisher can be severe. The problem is further complicated by data and server replication to satisfy availability and scalability requirements. To our knowledge this work is the first of its kind to give general approaches for reducing the trust required of publishers of large databases. To do this, we separate the roles of data owner and data publisher. With a few digital signatures on the part of the owner and no trust required of a publisher, we give techniques based on Merkle hash trees that publishers can use to provide authenticity and non-repudiation of the answer to database queries posed by a client. This is done without requiring a key to be held in an on-line system, thus reducing the impact of system penetrations. By reducing the trust required of the publisher, our solution is a step towards the publication of large databases in a scalable manner.},

	abstract = {Eight classes of chemosensory neurons in C. elegans fill with fluorescein when living animals are placed in a dye solution. Fluorescein enters the neurons through their exposed sensory cilia. Mutations in 14 genes prevent dye uptake and disrupt chemosensory behaviors. Each of these genes affects the ultrastructure of the chemosensory cilia or their accessory cells. In each case, the cilia are shorter or less exposed than normal, suggesting that dye contact is the principal factor under selection. Ten genes affect many or all of the sensory cilia in the head. The daf-19 (m86) mutation eliminates all cilia, leaving only occasional centrioles in the dendrites. The cilia in che-13 (e1805), osm-1 (p808), osm-5 (p813), and osm-6 (p811) mutants have normal transition zones and severely shortened axonemes. Doublet-microtubules, attached to the membrane by Y links, assemble ectopically proximal to the cilia in these mutants. The amphid cilia in che-11 (e1810) are irregular in diameter and contain dark ground material in the middle of the axonemes. Certain mechanocilia are also affected. The amphid cilia in che-10 (e1809) apparently degenerate, leaving dendrites with bulb-shaped endings filled with dark ground material. The mechanocilia lack striated rootlets. Cilia defects have also been found in che-2, che-3, and daf-10 mutants. The osm-3 (p802) mutation specifically eliminates the distal segment of the amphid cilia. Mutations in three genes affect sensillar support cells. The che-12 (e1812) mutation eliminates matrix material normally secreted by the amphid sheath cell. The che-14 (e1960) mutation disrupts the joining of the amphid sheath and socket cells to form the receptor channel. A similar defect has been observed in daf-6 mutants. Four additional genes affect specific classes of ciliated sensory neurons. The mec-1 and mec-8 (e398) mutations disrupt the fasciculation of the amphid cilia. The cat-6 (e1861) mutation disrupts the tubular bodies of the {CEP} mechanocilia. A cryophilic thermotaxis mutant, ttx-1 (p767), lacks fingers on the {AFD} dendrite, suggesting this neuron is thermosensory.},

	abstract = {Sterol carrier protein-2 ({SCP-2)} was independently discovered as a soluble protein that binds and transfers cholesterol as well as phospholipids (nonspecific lipid transfer protein, {nsLTP)} in vitro. Physiological functions of this protein are only now beginning to be resolved. The gene encoding {SCP-2} also encodes sterol carrier protein-x ({SCP-x)} arising from an alternate transcription site. In vitro and in vivo {SCP-x} serves as a peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-{CoA} thiolase in oxidation of branched-chain lipids (cholesterol to form bile acids; branched-chain fatty acid for detoxification). While peroxisomal {SCP-2} facilitates branched-chain lipid oxidation, the role(s) of extraperoxisomal (up to 50\% of total) are less clear. Studies using transfected fibroblasts overexpressing {SCP-2} and hepatocytes from {SCP-2/SCP-x} gene-ablated mice reveal that {SCP-2} selectively remodels the lipid composition, structure, and function of lipid rafts/caveolae. Studies of purified {SCP-2} and in cells show that {SCP-2} has high affinity for and selectively transfers many lipid species involved in intracellular signaling: fatty acids, fatty acyl {CoAs}, lysophosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositols, and sphingolipids (sphingomyelin, ceramide, mono-di-and multi-hexosylceramides, gangliosides). {SCP-2} selectively redistributes these signaling lipids between lipid rafts/caveolae and intracellular sites. These findings suggest {SCP-2} serves not only in cholesterol and phospholipid transfer, but also in regulating multiple lipid signaling pathways in lipid raft/caveolae microdomains of the plasma membrane.},

	abstract = {A study of the behavior and ecology of the spectacled bear, Tremarctos ornatus, in Peru revealed that they occur in all three ranges of the Peruvian Andes, with the majority in the "ceja de selva," or eastern slope of the Cordillera Oriental. As evidenced by feeding sign and contents of scats, 83 foods were confirmed in the diet of spectacled bears. These include insects, rodents, livestock, corn, berries, tree wood, bamboo hearts, palm frond petioles, 22 species of Bromeliaceae, 11 species of Cactaceae, and the fruits of 31 species of trees. Spectacled bears feed predominately on bromeliad hearts, particularly during the months when fruits are not ripe. From February to July, when most of the fruits are ripe, the animals move to the sources of these preferred foods. Direct observations provided information on the bear's corn-eating behavior. Certain other behavioral activities, such as the building of tree nests, were confirmed. Humid forests between 1,900 and 2,350 m in elevation, and coastal thorn forests are preferred habitats when water is available. Spectacled bears enjoy the most protection in the saturated rain forests in the "ceja de selva" and in the seasonally occupied areas at the upper extreme of the animal's elevational range. The spectacled bear is not in immediate danger of extinction in Peru owing to its adaptation to a diversity of habitats and the difficulty of access to bear areas with more than 45-degree slopes.},

These puncta colocalize with and localize the mechanosensory channel complex in the touch neurons. In turn, the production of the {MEC-1} and {MEC-5} puncta appears to rely on interactions with the neighboring epidermal tissue. These and other observations lead us to propose that extracellular, but not cytoskeletal, tethering of the degenerin channel is needed for mechanosensory transduction. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate an important role of the {ECM} in organizing the placement of the channel complex.},

	abstract = {The embryonic cell lineage of Caenorhabditis elegans has been traced from zygote to newly hatched larva, with the result that the entire cell lineage of this organism is now known. During embryogenesis 671 cells are generated; in the hermaphrodite 113 of these (in the male 111) undergo programmed death and the remainder either differentiate terminally or become postembryonic blast cells. The embryonic lineage is highly invariant, as are the fates of the cells to which it gives rise. In spite of the fixed relationship between cell ancestry and cell fate, the correlation between them lacks much obvious pattern. Thus, although most neurons arise from the embryonic ectoderm, some are produced by the mesoderm and a few are sisters to muscles; again, lineal boundaries do not necessarily coincide with functional boundaries. Nevertheless, cell ablation experiments (as well as previous cell isolation experiments) demonstrate substantial cell autonomy in at least some sections of embryogenesis. We conclude that the cell lineage itself, complex as it is, plays an important role in determining cell fate. We discuss the origin of the repeat units (partial segments) in the body wall, the generation of the various orders of symmetry, the analysis of the lineage in terms of sublineages, and evolutionary implications.},

In the absence of intensity gradient, using a light beam to pull a particle backwards is counter intuitive. Here, we show that it is possible to realize a backward scattering force which pulls a particle all the way towards the source without an equilibrium point. The underlining physics is the maximization of forward scattering via interference of the radiation multipoles. We show explicitly that the necessary condition to realize a negative (pulling) optical force is the simultaneous excitation of multipoles in the particle and if the projection of the total photon momentum along the propagation direction is small (as in some propagation invariant beams), attractive optical force is possible. This possibility adds "pulling" as an additional degree of freedom to optical micromanipulation.},

Available forest cover is highly degraded, fragmented and interspersed   with agricultural crop fields, and small townships. Data since 1990   onwards reveal 28 cases of human death by wild animals, comprising of 13   men and 15 women. Except 2, all casualties were caused by sloth bear.   801 incidences of human mauling comprised of 591 men and 210 women were   registered by Forest Department. A maximum of 528 incidences of mauling   were caused by sloth bear followed by 220 and 53 by jackals and other   wild animals respectively. Range of incidences per month varied from   51-93 with a mean 66.8 [plus or minus] 14.8. In Marwahi range 72.5\%   incidences of human mauling occurred in village area followed by 18.5\%   and 9.0\% in forest and house respectively. Altogether 1453 incidences of   livestock lifting were recorded in Marwahi forest division. No major   changes were observed in extent of biotic pressure. However, extraction   of stones from bear den sites has increased considerably. People need to   be educated and made aware of ecology, feeding habits, movement and   behaviour of problematic animals such as sloth bear, jackal, hyena and   leopard through seminars and workshop so that people can avoid   confrontation and play an active role in conservation. Livestock should   be properly protected by villagers in enclosures made up of rubble wall.   Sloth bear population has declined by 40\% during last six years so there   is a need to monitor the status of sloth bear population in the area.},

	abstract = {Because Caenorhabditis elegans lacks several components of the de novo sterol biosynthetic pathway, it requires sterol as an essential nutrient. Supplemented cholesterol undergoes extensive enzymatic modification in C. elegans to form other sterols of unknown function. 7-Dehydrocholesterol reductase ({DHCR)} catalyzes the reduction of the Delta7 double bond of sterols and is suspected to be defective in C. elegans, in which the major endogenous sterol is 7-dehydrocholesterol ({7DHC).} We microinjected a human {DHCR} expression vector into C. elegans, which was then incorporated into chromosome by gamma-radiation. This transgenic C. elegans was named cholegans, i.e., cholesterol-producing C. elegans, because it was able to convert {7DHC} into cholesterol. We investigated the effects of changes in sterol composition on longevity and stress resistance by examining brood size, mean life span, {UV} resistance, and thermotolerance. Cholegans contained 80\% more cholesterol than the wild-type control. The brood size of cholegans was reduced by 40\% compared to the wild-type control, although the growth rate was not significantly changed. The mean life span of cholegans was increased up to 131\% in sterol-deficient medium as compared to wild-type. The biochemical basis for life span extension of cholegans appears to partly result from its acquired resistance against both {UV} irradiation and thermal stress.},

	abstract = {Upon starvation or overcrowding, Caenorhabditis elegans interrupts its reproductive cycle and forms a specialised larva called dauer (enduring). This process is regulated by {TGF-beta} and insulin-signalling pathways and is connected with the control of life span through the insulin pathway components {DAF-2} and {DAF-16.} We found that replacing cholesterol with its methylated metabolite lophenol induced worms to form dauer larvae in the presence of food and low population density. Our data indicate that methylated sterols do not actively induce the dauer formation but rather that the reproductive growth requires a cholesterol-derived hormone that cannot be produced from methylated sterols. Using the effect of lophenol on growth, we have partially purified activity, named gamravali, which promotes the reproduction. In addition, the effect of lophenol allowed us to determine the role of sterols during dauer larva formation and longevity. In the absence of gamravali, the nuclear hormone receptor {DAF-12} is activated and thereby initiates the dauer formation program. Active {DAF-12} triggers in neurons the nuclear import of {DAF-16}, a forkhead domain transcription factor that contributes to dauer differentiation. This hormonal control of {DAF-16} activation is, however, independent of insulin signalling and has no influence on life span.},

	abstract = {The two major functions of a scientific publishing system are to provide access to and evaluation of scientific papers. While open access ({OA)} is becoming a reality, open evaluation ({OE)}, the other side of the coin, has received less attention. Evaluation steers the attention of the scientific community and thus the very course of science. It also influences the use of scientific findings in public policy. The current system of scientific publishing provides only journal prestige as an indication of the quality of new papers and relies on a non-transparent and noisy pre-publication peer-review process, which delays publication by many months on average. Here I propose an {OE} system, in which papers are evaluated post-publication in an ongoing fashion by means of open peer review and rating. Through signed ratings and reviews, scientists steer the attention of their field and build their reputation. Reviewers are motivated to be objective, because low-quality or self-serving signed evaluations will negatively impact their reputation. A core feature of this proposal is a division of powers between the accumulation of evaluative evidence and the analysis of this evidence by paper evaluation functions ({PEFs).} {PEFs} can be freely defined by individuals or groups (e.g., scientific societies) and provide a plurality of perspectives on the scientific literature. Simple {PEFs} will use averages of ratings, weighting reviewers (e.g., by H-index), and rating scales (e.g., by relevance to a decision process) in different ways. Complex {PEFs} will use advanced statistical techniques to infer the quality of a paper. Papers with initially promising ratings will be more deeply evaluated. The continual refinement of {PEFs} in response to attempts by individuals to influence evaluations in their own favor will make the system ungameable. {OA} and {OE} together have the power to revolutionize scientific publishing and usher in a new culture of transparency, constructive criticism, and collaboration.},

	abstract = {Prohibitin, which consists of two subunits {PHB1} and {PHB2}, plays a role in cell-cycle progression, senescence, apoptosis, and maintenance of mitochondrial function in mammals and yeast. In this study, we examined the role of prohibitins in plants by using virus-induced gene silencing ({VIGS)} of two prohibitin subunit genes of Nicotiana benthamiana, designated {NbPHB1} and {NbPHB2.} {NbPHB1} and {NbPHB2} were targeted to the mitochondria, and their gene expression was suppressed during senescence. {VIGS} of {NbPHB2} caused severe growth inhibition, leaf yellowing and symptoms of cell death, whereas {VIGS} of {NbPHB1} resulted in a milder phenotype. At the cellular level, depletion of these subunits affected mitochondria by severely reducing their number and/or mass, and by causing morphological and physiological abnormalities. Suppression of prohibitin function resulted in a 10- to 20-fold higher production of reactive oxygen species and induced premature leaf senescence. Finally, disruption of prohibitin function rendered the plants more susceptible to various oxidative stress-inducing reagents, including H({2)O(2)}, paraquat, antimycin A and salicylic acid. These results suggest that prohibitins play a crucial role in mitochondrial biogenesis and protection against stress and senescence in plant cells.},

	abstract = {The molecular mechanism whereby vertebrate primary sensory neurons convert mechanical energy at their receptive fields into action potentials is unknown. In recent years, genetic screens for touch insensitive mutants of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans have led to the identification of several genes required for mechanical sensitivity. A model has been proposed in which a mechanically gated ion channel is connected both to the extracellular matrix and to the cytoskeleton. Displacement of the membrane is proposed to produce a shearing force that pulls the channel open. {MEC-2} is thought to play an important role in this complex by linking the ion channel to the cytoskeleton. {MEC-2} is highly homologous to a vertebrate protein called stomatin. Stomatin was first isolated from erythrocytes where it is a major integral membrane protein. To date, however, no data on neuronal expression of stomatin in the peripheral nervous system ({PNS)} or central nervous system ({CNS)} is available. Here, we have used {RT-PCR}, in situ hybridization, Northern blotting, and immunocytochemistry to demonstrate that stomatin is expressed by all sensory neurons in mouse dorsal root ganglia. Indirect immunofluorescence together with transfection of cultured adult sensory neurons with epitope-tagged stomatin show that stomatin is localized in spots on somatic and axonal membranes. During development, stomatin begins to be expressed by sensory neurons only as target innervation occurs. The onset of expression of stomatin thus coincides with the onset of functional mechanical sensitivity. Together, our data suggest that stomatin, like the C. elegans {MEC-2} gene, is expressed in an appropriate temporal and spatial manner to participate in a putative vertebrate mechanotransduction complex.},

	title = {Rethinking Peer Review},
	url = {http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/rethinking-peer-review},
	abstract = {The past few years have been a period of significant turmoil \&mdash; some of it quite constructive \&mdash; for publishers and editors of science journals. Controversies regarding potential conflicts of interest have led some journals to reexamine their rules for revealing the financial relationships of published researchers. Competition from free online \&ldquo;open access\&rdquo; journals, such as the six new journals published by the nonprofit Public Library of Science, has led several mainstream print journals to beef up their online offerings. And some notable journals concerned about fraudulent research have reportedly improved the screening of manuscripts under consideration, in an attempt to catch those who would misrepresent or \&ldquo;beautify\&rdquo; their data. ({\&ldquo;Let\&rsquo;s} celebrate real data,\&rdquo; the editors of Nature Cell Biology recently wrote, \&ldquo;wrinkles, warts, and all.\&rdquo;)
The most interesting change stirring in the world of science and medical journals \&mdash; and the change likely to have the most far-reaching impact \&mdash; relates to peer review. Also known as \&ldquo;refereeing,\&rdquo; the peer review process is used by journal editors to aid in deciding which papers are worth publishing. Some researchers may assume that peer review is a nuisance that scientists have always had to tolerate in order to be published. In reality, peer review is a fairly recent innovation, not widespread until the middle of the twentieth century. In the nineteenth century, many science journals were commandingly led by what Ohio State University science historian John C. Burnham dubbed \&ldquo;crusading and colorful editors,\&rdquo; who made their publications \&ldquo;personal mouthpieces\&rdquo; for their individual views. There were often more journals than scientific and medical papers to publish; the last thing needed was a process for weeding out articles.
In time, the specialization of science precluded editors from being qualified to evaluate all the submissions they received. About a century ago, Burnham notes, science journals began to direct papers to distinguished experts who would serve on affiliated editorial boards. Eventually \&mdash; especially following the post-World War {II} research boom \&mdash; the deluge of manuscripts and their increasing specialization made it difficult for even an editorial board of a dozen or so experts to handle the load. The peer review system developed to meet this need. Journal editors began to seek out experts capable of commenting on manuscripts \&mdash; not only researchers in the same general field, but researchers familiar with the specific techniques and even laboratory materials described in the papers under consideration. The transition from the editorial board model to the peer review model was eased by technological advances, like the Xerox copier in 1959, that reduced the hassles of sending manuscripts to experts scattered around the globe. There remained holdouts for a while \&mdash; as Burnham notes, the Tennessee Medical Association Journal operated without peer review under one strong editor until 1971 \&mdash; but all major scientific and medical journals have relied on peer review for decades.
In recent times, the term \&ldquo;peer reviewed\&rdquo; has come to serve as shorthand for \&ldquo;quality.\&rdquo; To say that an article appeared in a peer-reviewed scientific journal is to claim a kind of professional approbation; to say that a study hasn\&rsquo;t been peer reviewed is tantamount to calling it disreputable. Up to a point, this is reasonable. Reviewers and editors serve as gatekeepers in scientific publishing; they eliminate the most uninteresting or least worthy articles, saving the research community time and money.
But peer review is not simply synonymous with quality. Many landmark scientific papers (like that of Watson and Crick, published just five decades ago) were never subjected to peer review, and as David Shatz has pointed out, \&ldquo;many heavily cited papers, including some describing work which won a Nobel Prize, were originally rejected by peer review.\&rdquo; Shatz, a Yeshiva University philosophy professor, outlines some of the charges made against the referee process in his 2004 book Peer Review: A Critical Inquiry. In a word, reviewers are often not really \&ldquo;conversant with the published literature\&rdquo;; they are \&ldquo;biased toward papers that affirm their prior convictions\&rdquo;; and they \&ldquo;are biased against innovation and/or are poor judges of quality.\&rdquo; Reviewers also seem biased in favor of authors from prestigious institutions. Shatz describes a study in which \&ldquo;papers that had been published in journals by authors from prestigious institutions were retyped and resubmitted with a non-prestigious affiliation indicated for the author. Not only did referees mostly fail to recognize these previously published papers in their field, they recommended rejection.\&rdquo;
The Cochrane Collaboration, an international healthcare analysis group based in the {U.K.}, published a report in 2003 concluding that there is \&ldquo;little empirical evidence to support the use of editorial peer review as a mechanism to ensure quality of biomedical research, despite its widespread use and costs.\&rdquo; The Royal Society has also studied the effects of peer review. As the chairman of the investigating committee told a British newspaper in 2003, {\&ldquo;We} are all aware that some referees\&rsquo; reports are not worth the paper they are written on. It\&rsquo;s also hard for a journal editor when reports come back that are contradictory, and it\&rsquo;s often down to a question of a value judgment whether something is published or not.\&rdquo; He also pointed out that peer review has been criticized for being used by the scientific establishment \&ldquo;to prevent unorthodox ideas, methods, and views, regardless of their merit, from being made public\&rdquo; and for its secretiveness and anonymity. Some journals have started printing the names of each article\&rsquo;s referees; the British Medical Journal ({BMJ)}, for instance, decided to discontinue anonymous peer reviews in 1999. The new system, called \&ldquo;open peer review,\&rdquo; allows for more transparency and accountability but may discourage junior scientists from critically reviewing the work of more senior researchers for fear of reprisal.
Perhaps the most powerful criticism of peer review is that it fails to achieve its core objective: quality control. Shatz describes a study in which \&ldquo;investigators deliberately inserted errors into a manuscript, and referees did a poor job of detecting them.\&rdquo; And critics of peer review need look no further than recent high-profile papers that turned out to be hoaxes \&mdash; like the massive case of scientific fraud perpetrated by South Korean stem cell researcher Hwang Woo Suk in Science. Of course, no one should expect a perfect system, or condemn peer review as a whole for its occasional failures. Back in 2003, the editors of Nature Immunology lamented \&ldquo;the expectation in the popular press that peer review is a process by which fraudulent data is detected before publication.\&rdquo; Peer reviewers, they argued, cannot be expected \&ldquo;to ferret out cleverly concealed, deliberate deceptions.\&rdquo; But even granting this truth, the question remains: Is peer review the best process for promoting the highest quality science?
Beyond the many criticisms of peer review \&mdash; some new, some perennial \&mdash; two recent developments are especially intriguing. First, the open-access journals, which already make use of the Internet as their basic means of publication, are now finding ways to incorporate many so-called {\&ldquo;Web} 2.0\&rdquo; tools for collaboration, comment, and criticism. So, for example, a forthcoming multidisciplinary academic journal called Philica seeks to institute a peer-review process that is \&ldquo;transparent\&rdquo; (meaning that \&ldquo;reviews can be seen publicly\&rdquo;) and \&ldquo;dynamic\&rdquo; (\&ldquo;because opinions can change over time, and this is reflected in the review process\&rdquo;). Instead of following the print-journal model of publishing articles after peer-review, Philica will publish articles before peer-review. {\&ldquo;When} somebody reviews your article, the impact of that review depends on the reviewer\&rsquo;s own reviews,\&rdquo; the Philica website says. {\&ldquo;This} means that the opinion of somebody whose work is highly regarded carries more weight than the opinion of somebody whose work is rated poorly. A person\&rsquo;s standing, and so their impact on other people\&rsquo;s ratings, changes constantly as part of the dynamic Philica world. Ideas and opinions change all the time \&mdash; Philica lets us see this. This really is publishing like never before.\&rdquo;
Another new open-access journal is likely to have an even bigger impact on the scientific community. The Public Library of Science will be launching its seventh journal in November 2006, called {PLoS} {ONE.} In an implicit challenge to Nature and Science, {PLoS} {ONE} will be the first of the group\&rsquo;s journals to publish articles in all areas of science and medicine. Articles published in the new journal will undergo peer review, but some of the standard criteria that older journals use to screen out articles \&mdash; like \&ldquo;degree of advance\&rdquo; or \&ldquo;interest to a general reader\&rdquo; \&mdash; won\&rsquo;t be used by {PLoS} {ONE} reviewers; all papers of scientific merit will be posted to the public record. Only weeks (not months) will go by before a submitted article is published, since instead of coming out periodically issue-by-issue, {PLoS} {ONE} will be in a state of continuous publication. A more public review process will continue after publication, as readers will be able to rate, annotate, and comment on papers, and authors can respond to their comments. The original paper will remain as such, but comments, revisions, and updates will orbit nearby, an electronic Talmud on every article of significance.
It is easy to believe, in reading the plans for this new publication, that it truly represents \&ldquo;the first step\&rdquo; in a wonderful \&ldquo;revolution\&rdquo; (as the Public Library of Science puts it). But it is worth remembering that gates and gatekeepers serve the important function of keeping out barbarians; it would be regrettable if the world of science journals came to suffer the sort of \&ldquo;trolling\&rdquo; and \&ldquo;flaming\&rdquo; so common today in comments on blogs and Internet discussion boards. It would be unfortunate if the deliberate, measured character of scientific research and discourse were lost to a culture of speed, hype, and quick-hit comments.
The second major development is that traditional peer review is under reconsideration even within the heart of establishment scientific publishing. This summer, the journal Nature is experimenting with a similar system of public review. Although the journal\&rsquo;s articles will continue to go through the standard closed peer review process, a public version of peer review will be working in parallel: certain submissions will be posted online to solicit reader feedback, in hopes that experts will voluntarily review the articles. If this experiment shows that posted \&ldquo;pre-prints\&rdquo; receive enough attention online, Nature will apparently consider altering its traditional peer review practices. The journal is meanwhile sponsoring an ongoing online debate about peer review, with articles about the pros, cons, and future of refereeing.
What to make of all this? Peer review will surely not disappear overnight, but there are clear indications that it will evolve in the next few years as the established journals come to terms with Internet publication. Already in some fields of science, like physics and astronomy, the print journals have receded in importance due to online repositories like {arXiv} (pronounced \&ldquo;archive\&rdquo;) that disseminate studies without the hassle of peer review. The last few decades of peer review may someday be remembered as a peculiar period in the history of science, an aberration produced by an explosion of researcher productivity and the constraints of print publication, eventually superseded by a fuller, nonstop scientific conversation. But we should not declare a revolution too soon or dismiss too easily the significant achievements of the current system, even as we acknowledge its many shortcomings and prepare to take full advantage of the new technologies of publishing.},

Denatured {PhoA} also prevented the aggregation of {FtsH}, and these two proteins co-sedimented through a sucrose gradient. Binding between {FtsH-His6-Myc} and detergent-solubilized {SecY} was also demonstrated. Although {FtsH-bound} {SecY} was processed further for {ATP-dependent} proteolysis, {FtsH-bound} {PhoA} was not. Thus, {FtsH} association with denatured {PhoA} is uncoupled from proteolysis. Overproduction of {FtsH} significantly increased the cytoplasmic localization of the {PhoA} moiety of a {MalF-PhoA} hybrid protein, in which a charged residue had been introduced into a transmembrane segment. Thus, denatured {PhoA} binding of {FtsH} may also occur in vivo.},

To correlate gene amplification with message level, we used real-time quantitative {PCR} to measure {hTERT} {mRNA} in 50 embryonal brain tumors. {hTERT} {mRNA} was detected in all but one of these cases, and {mRNA} level correlated significantly with gene dosage (r = 0.82). Log-rank analysis of survival data revealed a trend toward poor clinical outcomes in patients with medulloblastomas containing high {hTERT} {mRNA} levels, but clinical follow-up was relatively short and the association was not statistically significant (P = 0.078). Comparative genomic hybridization was used to further analyze the tumor with the greatest {hTERT} gene dosage and {mRNA} level, a recurrent medulloepithelioma. {hTERT} was amplified in the recurrent tumor but not in the primary lesion, suggesting this locus can be involved in tumor progression. Our data indicate that {hTERT} gene amplification is relatively common in embryonal brain tumors, and that increased expression of {hTERT} {mRNA} may be associated with biologically aggressive tumor behavior.},

Both the type (visual, olfactory, gustatory, mechanical or auditory) and the quality of a stimulus (spatial position, intensity or frequency) are represented as a neural code. Here we undertake a genetic analysis of sensory modality coding in Caenorhabditis elegans. The {ASH} sensory neurons respond to two distinct sensory stimuli (nose touch and osmotic stimuli). A mutation in the glr-1 (glutamate receptor) gene eliminates the response to nose touch but not to osmotic repellents. The predicted {GLR-1} protein is roughly 40\% identical to mammalian {AMPA-class} glutamate receptor ({GluR)} subunits. Analysis of glr-1 expression and genetic mosaics indicates that {GLR-1} receptors act in synaptic targets of the {ASH} neurons. We propose that discrimination between the {ASH} sensory modalities arises from differential release of {ASH} neurotransmitters in response to different stimuli.},

	abstract = {The neuronal stomatin-like proteins {UNC-1} and {UNC-24} play important roles in the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans. These neuronal stomatin-like proteins are putative chaperone proteins that can modify volatile anesthetic sensitivity and disrupt coordinated locomotion. A suppressor of unc-1 and unc-24, named ssu-1(fc73) (for suppressor of stomatin uncoordination), suppresses three phenotypes of neuronal stomatin-like protein deficiency as follows: volatile anesthetic sensitivity, uncoordinated locomotion, and a constitutive alternative developmental phenotype known as dauer. Here we provide the first phenotypic characterization of ssu-1, predicted to be the only C. elegans cytosolic alcohol sulfotransferase, a family of enzymes that catalyze a sulfate linkage with the alcohol group of small molecules for the purposes of detoxification or modification of signaling. In vitro enzyme analysis of bacterially expressed {SSU-1} demonstrates sulfotransferase activity and thus confirms the function predicted by protein sequence similarities. Whereas unc-1 is expressed in the majority of neurons of C. elegans, expression of {SSU-1} protein in only the two {ASJ} amphid interneurons is sufficient to restore the wild type phenotype. This work demonstrates that {SSU-1} is a functional sulfotransferase that likely modifies endocrine signaling in C. elegans. The expression of {SSU-1} in the {ASJ} neurons refines the understanding of the function of these cells and supports their classification as endocrine tissue. The relationship of unc-1, unc-24, and ssu-1 is the first association of neuronal stomatin-like proteins sharing regulatory roles with a sulfotransferase enzyme.},

Appropriately placed double-strand breaks stimulated homologous recombination during array formation.

Caenorhabditis elegans cyclic nucleotide-gated channel mutants respond normally to some olfactory stimuli and to osmotic stimuli, suggesting that these chemosensory responses use an alternative sensory transduction pathway. One gene that may act in this pathway is osm-9, which is required for each of these responses as well as a mechanosensory response to nose touch. osm-9 encodes a protein with ankyrin repeats and multiple predicted transmembrane domains that has limited similarity to the Drosophila phototransduction channels transient receptor potential ({TRP)} and {TRP-like} ({TRPL).} The sequence of {OSM-9} and other {TRP-like} genes reveals a previously unsuspected diversity of mammalian and invertebrate genes in this family. osm-9 is required for the activity of the predicted G-protein-coupled odorant receptor {ODR-10}, which acts in the {AWA} olfactory neurons; its similarity to other G-protein-regulated transduction channels suggests that {OSM-9} is involved in {AWA} signaling. osm-9:: {GFP} fusion genes are expressed in a subset of chemosensory, mechanosensory, and osmosensory neurons. osm-9 also affects olfactory adaptation within neurons that require the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel for olfaction; in these neurons, the gene has a regulatory function and not a primary role in sensory transduction.},

	abstract = {While our understanding of lipid microdomains has advanced in recent years, many aspects of their formation and dynamics are still unclear. In particular, the molecular determinants that facilitate the partitioning of integral membrane proteins into lipid raft domains are yet to be clarified. This review focuses on a family of raft-associated integral membrane proteins, termed flotillins, which belongs to a larger class of integral membrane proteins that carry an evolutionarily conserved domain called the prohibitin homology ({PHB)} domain. A number of studies now suggest that eucaryotic proteins carrying this domain have affinity for lipid raft domains. The {PHB} domain is carried by a diverse array of proteins including stomatin, podocin, the archetypal {PHB} protein, prohibitin, lower eucaryotic proteins such as the Dictyostelium discoideum proteins vacuolin A and vacuolin B and the Caenorhabditis elegans proteins unc-1, unc-24 and mec-2. The presence of this domain in some procaryotic proteins suggests that the {PHB} domain may constitute a primordial lipid recognition motif. Recent work has provided new insights into the trafficking and targeting of flotillin and other {PHB} domain proteins. While the function of this large family of proteins remains unclear, studies of the C. elegans {PHB} proteins suggest possible links to a class of volatile anaesthetics raising the possibility that these lipophilic agents could influence lipid raft domains. This review will discuss recent insights into the cell biology of flotillins and the large family of evolutionarily conserved {PHB} domain proteins.},

	abstract = {{SYNOPSIS.} The canid reproductive system includes many features that are unusual or even unique among mammals. Focusing on gray wolves, for example, these include monogamy, monestrum with exceptionally long proestrous and diestrous phases, a copulatory lock or tie, incorporation of adult young into the social group, behavioral suppression of mating in these subordinate young, obligate pseudopregnancy in subordinate females, and alloparental care. These features can be analyzed on the levels of both proximate and ultimate causation by considering them in the context of the reproductive system as a whole. First, when assessing possible proximate mechanisms, monestrum appears to be pivotal. It is probably accomplished by the extremely long luteal or diestrous phase, which is followed by a seasonal peak in prolactin. Two sequellae of the extended diestrus (or pseudopregnancy) in non-pregnant subordinate females are to 1) suppress any subsequent cycles, and 2) hormonally prime them to behave maternally. The prolactin peak in all adult pack members, coincident with the birth of pups, also may stimulate parental behavior. The risk of monestrum (limited chance for conception) appears to be reduced by the relatively long proestrous and estrous periods, as well as by monogamy. The adaptive value, or ultimate cause, of this reproductive system is most obvious for the more social canid species, such as the gray wolf. That is, advantages to sociality, such as cooperative hunting, may have driven development of the anomalies of the reproductive system.},

The first exon contains the 5'-untranslated region (61 nucleotides) and the coding sequence for the N-terminal domain; the second exon encodes the hydrophobic domain, including flanking cysteine and lysine residues. Exon 7 contains the C-terminal portion and a 2-kb 3'-untranslated region. The potential promoter region contains several consensus sequences for ubiquitous transcription factors (Sp1, {AP1}, {AP2}, {CP1/2}, {NF} kappa B, {CREB}, Ets-1, and {CACC/GT-BF)} and two imperfect sequences for erythroid factors ({EKLF} and {GATA-1)}, in accordance with the ubiquitous distribution of the {EPB72} {mRNA} in different cell types. No {TATA} box was apparent. An inverted Alu repeat element, flanked by nonamer direct repeats, was identified within the region -913/-620, relative to the cap site. Six additional Alu repeat elements, including one monomer and one trimer, were identified within the introns and the 3'-untranslated region.

It is increasingly appreciated that cholesterol-rich microdomains in the plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells represent an organizing nexus for multiple cellular proteins involved in transmembrane nutrient uptake (cholesterol, fatty acid, glucose, etc.), cell-signaling, immune recognition, pathogen entry, and many other roles. Despite these advances, however, relatively little is known regarding the organization of cholesterol itself in these plasma membrane microdomains. Although a variety of non-sterol markers indicate the presence of microdomains in the plasma membranes of living cells, none of these studies have demonstrated that cholesterol is enriched in these microdomains in living cells. Further, the role of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains as targets for intracellular cholesterol trafficking proteins such as sterol carrier protein-2 ({SCP-2)} that facilitate cholesterol uptake and transcellular transport for targeting storage (cholesterol esters) or efflux is only beginning to be understood. Herein, we summarize the background as well as recent progress in this field that has advanced our understanding of these issues.},

Can the niche services of individual librarians across multiple libraries be developed into a suite of standard services available to all scientists that support the entire research lifecycle?

Setting:
Services at a large, research-intensive state university campus are described.

Method:
Initial data were collected via concept mapping by librarians. Additional data were collected at conferences and meetings through interactive poster presentations.

Main Results:
Services of interest to scientists for each of the stages in the research lifecycle were developed by the team to reflect the wide range of strengths of team members in aggregate.

Conclusion:
Input from researchers was the most effective tool for developing the model. A flexible research lifecycle model can be developed to match the needs of different service groups and the skills of different librarians.},

The evolutionary conservation and the ubiquitous expression in mammalian tissues of the prohibitin complex suggest an important function among eukaryotes. The {PHB} complex has been shown to play a role in the stabilization of newly synthesized subunits of mitochondrial respiratory enzymes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have used Caenorhabditis elegans as model system to study the role of the {PHB} complex during development of a multicellular organism. We demonstrate that prohibitins in C. elegans form a high molecular weight complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane similar to that of yeast and humans. By using {RNA-mediated} gene inactivation, we show that {PHB} proteins are essential during embryonic development and are required for somatic and germline differentiation in the larval gonad. We further demonstrate that a deficiency in {PHB} proteins results in altered mitochondrial biogenesis in body wall muscle cells. This paper reports a strong loss of function phenotype for prohibitin gene inactivation in a multicellular organism and shows for the first time that prohibitins serve an essential role in mitochondrial function during organismal development.},

	abstract = {Reproductive success of co-operatively-breeding slender-tailed meerkats (Suricata suricatta) in the Kalahari was monitored over four breeding seasons and 26 band years, concentrating on three focal bands. Breeding was strongly seasonal, with peak numbers of births coinciding with maximum rainfall between January and March. Breeding seasons were extended, and more litters were produced, during the years with above average rainfall. For dominant females, the mean annual rate of litter production was 1.9 ± 0.8 litters per year and short interbirth intervals (mean = 90 {\%pL} 18 days) indicated that females came into oestrus within three weeks of giving birth. Births were synchronous within but not between bands. Major known causes of kitten mortality were cold weather and predation, and losses mainly occurred between three and five weeks of age. Sixty-seven percent of juveniles survived between emergence from the den at three or four weeks old and attainment of effective foraging independence at 12 weeks. There were no significant effects of birth date within the season upon litter size or survival. Several incidents of apparent infanticide were recorded. These meerkats were highly co-operative and adult band members assiduously guarded and provisioned the kittens. Nevertheless, regression analysis showed that neither rainfall (an index of prey availability) nor band size variables accounted for much variance in juvenile survival to 12 weeks, which appeared to be heavily influenced by chance events such as flash floods. In contrast, rainfall between January and March had a significantly positive effect on the total number of juveniles produced during the breeding year.},

All data are published as a dataset under a separate {DOI} within the paper
The dataset is indexed in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility simultaneously with the publication
The dataset is published as a {KML} (Keyhole Markup Language) file under a distinct {DOI}
The interactive map contains data for all specimens in the article and links to collections of images for each species in Morphbank
Data can be filtered to display or hide any family, genus, or species
All new taxa are registered at {ZooBank} during the publication process
All new taxa are provided to Encyclopedia of Life through {XML} mark up on the day of publication

These added semantic enhancements to the simple journal article provide rich information and visualization of the data behind the journal article, which is often hidden from the public view and difficult to obtain.
The approach laid out in this article is innovative and seems to address concerns about citation, use and reuse, and recognition of efforts. Of course, this approach takes much time to process all the additional information required beyond the journal article, but, hopefully, the additional effort will be outweighed by the additional recognition the scientists receive for doing it.

The analysis of these forests showed that the species composition varied between forest types. The shrub vegetation, not only was very characteristic but was also a major component in each forest, unlike in the tropical rain forest. The exact role of the shrubs in the dynamics of the tropical monsoon forests is not established, but is suggested that it may act as a buffer during the dry periods under a semi deciduous canopy. The sapling composition differed from the tree vegetation and indicated that the species composition may change with time in this forest. Mosaic theory or the patch dynamics may best explain the dynamics of this tropical monsoon forest which is a mixture of forest types. More studies are required before generalisations can be made of tropical monsoon forests.},

In this review, we first describe the actions of transcription factors within motor neuron progenitors, which initiate a cascade of transcriptional interactions that lead to motor neuron specification. We next highlight the contribution of the {LIM} homeodomain ({LIM-HD)} transcription factors in establishing motor neuron subtype identity. Importantly, it has recently been shown that the combinatorial expression of {LIM-HD} transcription factors, the {LIM} code, confers motor neuron subtypes with the ability to select specific axon pathways to reach their distinct muscle targets. Finally, the downstream targets of the {LIM} code are discussed, especially in the context of subtype-specific motor axon pathfinding.},

The Cs and Ddc genes overlap at their 3' ends, implying that the transcription termination signals of these genes are polar, since each gene's primary transcript contains the complement of the other gene's transcription termination signals. The mature transcripts of the Cs and Ddc genes are complementary for a short distance and the primary transcripts may be complementary over thousands of base pairs. Despite intensive mutagenesis in this region, no mutations affecting the Cs transcript have been recovered although over 90 alleles of the two flanking genes (Ddc and l(2)amd) have been identified. Unlike the flanking Ddc and l(2)amd genes, the structure of the Cs gene and the temporal and tissue specificity of Cs expression are inconsistent with any structural or functional relatedness to the Ddc gene family. The internal structure of the Cs transcript is unlike that of most protein coding genes; it contains several open reading frames which are not situated favorably for efficient translation of the Cs message. This unusual internal structure may be the basis of the observed mutational silence of the Cs locus.},

This basal slowing response is mediated by a dopamine-containing neural circuit that senses a mechanical attribute of bacteria and may be an adaptive mechanism that increases the amount of time animals spend in the presence of food. Second, food-deprived wild-type animals, when transferred to bacteria, display a dramatically enhanced slowing response that ensures that the animals do not leave their newly encountered source of food. This experience-dependent response is mediated by serotonergic neurotransmission and is potentiated by fluoxetine (Prozac). The basal and enhanced slowing responses are distinct and separable neuromodulatory components of a genetically tractable paradigm of behavioral plasticity.},

We used in this report the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system to identify and characterize the genes that are affected by ethanol exposure and to link those genes functionally into an ethanol-induced gene network. By analyzing the expression profiles of all C. elegans {ORFs} using microarrays, we identified 230 genes affected by ethanol. While the ethanol response of some of the identified genes was significant at early time points, that of the majority was at late time points, indicating that the genes in the latter case might represent the physiological consequence of the ethanol exposure. We further characterized the early response genes that may represent those involved directly in the ethanol response. These genes included many heat shock protein genes, indicating that high concentration of ethanol acts as a strong stress to the animal. Interestingly, we identified two non-heat-shock protein genes that were specifically responsive to ethanol. glr-2 was the only glutamate receptor gene to be induced by ethanol. {T28C12.4}, which encodes a protein with limited homology to human neuroligin, was also specific to ethanol stress. Finally, by analyzing the promoter regions of the early response genes, we identified a regulatory element, {TCTGCGTCTCT}, that was necessary for the expression of subsets of ethanol response genes.},

We have used an antistomatin antibody to examine peripheral blood films, bone marrow, splenic tissue, and hepatic tissue from these patients by immunocytochemistry. This technique revealed that, in fact, some red cells did show positive stomatin immunoreactivity; and consistent with this result, Western blot analysis of the red cell membranes confirmed that about one twentieth to one fiftieth of the normal amount of stomatin was in fact present. Flow cytometry, combining immunoreactive quantitation of stomatin expression with thiazole orange staining for reticulocytes, showed that in {OHSt}, it was the young cells that had more stomatin. Magnetic-activated cell separation studies, using beads to which an anti-transferrin receptor antibody was conjugated, confirmed that in {OHSt} there was a correspondence between expression of stomatin and the transferrin receptor. Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting revealed that in {OHSt} patients, the protein was present in spleen, liver, neutrophils, platelets, monocytes, and about 50\% of the peripheral lymphocytes, with the same distribution as in healthy controls. Neither Southern blots, nor direct sequencing of multiple subclones of the {cDNA}, nor sequencing of amplicons from genomic {DNA} revealed any significant abnormality in stomatin gene sequence in these patients. The deficiency of stomatin from red cells appears to be due to a loss of stomatin from these red cells on maturation in the bone marrow and in the circulation.},

Multiple approaches using genetics, cell biology, biochemistry, and electrophysiology have characterized a channel complex, containing two {DEG/ENaC} pore-forming subunits and several other proteins, that transduces the touch response. Other mechanical responses, sensed by other cells using a variety of other components, are less well understood in C. elegans. Many of these other senses may use {TRP} channels, although {DEG/ENaC} channels have also been implicated.},

Self-peptide affinity for {CD172a} is near the optimum measured for human {CD172a} variants, and Self peptide also potently inhibits nanoparticle uptake mediated by the contractile cytoskeleton.

We report a formerly unappreciated sensory modality in bumblebees (Bombus terrestris), detection of floral electric fields. These fields act as floral cues, which are affected by the visit of naturally charged bees. Like visual cues, floral electric fields exhibit variations in pattern and structure, which can be discriminated by bumblebees. We also show that such electric field information contributes to the complex array of floral cues that together improve a pollinator's memory of floral rewards. Because floral electric fields can change within seconds, this sensory modality may facilitate rapid and dynamic communication between flowers and their pollinators.},

	abstract = {The group of {stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/HflK/C} ({SPFH)} domain-containing proteins comprise members of diverse subcellular localization and function. Association with detergent-resistant membranes ({DRMs)} and the propensity to form oligomers are two common properties of {SPFH} domain proteins and likely important for the function of these proteins. Our laboratory recently discovered two novel members of this protein group, which, based on their endoplasmic reticulum ({ER)} localization and association with {DRMs}, were named {ER} lipid raft-associated protein (erlin)-1 and -2. Here we characterized erlin oligomerization and identified domains within the erlins responsible for oligomerization and {DRM} association. Using co-immunoprecipitation and sucrose density gradient centrifugation approaches on endogenous and ectopically expressed erlin proteins, we found that they formed homo- and hetero-oligomers and were part of large multimeric complexes. These properties were independent of their {DRM} association. By analyzing truncation and point mutants of erlin-2 we discovered that interaction between erlin monomers (oligomerization) and association with high molecular weight complexes require distinct regions within the protein. Although oligomerization and {DRM} association were mediated by a region immediately downstream of the {SPFH} domain (residues 228-300), integration into high molecular weight complexes was absolutely dependent on a phenylalanine residue C-terminal of this region (Phe-305), which lies within a short stretch of hydrophobic residues. Our data demonstrate that lower order oligomerization and incorporation into multimeric complexes are two separate biochemical properties of the erlins, because they are mediated by distinct regions.},

	abstract = {Early body condition commonly has important downstream effects on fitness. One, as yet unexplored, mechanism behind these effects may be that condition in early life affects time budgets and hence opportunities to learn critical skills. Meerkat, Suricata suricatta, pups must choose between begging for food from helpers and foraging for themselves. I found that pups in good condition early in life invested more time in foraging than individuals in poor condition and subsequently developed greater foraging efficiency, which was maintained in later life. Young pups spent an average of 18\% of their time foraging, even though all pups were initially incompetent foragers and gained few direct benefits from their attempts. Pups whose hunger was reduced through experimental provisioning increased their investment in foraging. This suggests that investment in foraging is mediated by available energy reserves and raises the possibility that, although foraging is energetically costly, pups may gain long-term benefits by practising. Surprisingly, manipulating body weight through long-term experimental provisioning did not result in increased investment in foraging or improved foraging efficiency. Possible explanations for this result are considered. The findings presented here provide some support for the hypothesis that high body condition allows individuals to invest time in costly foraging practice, leading to the development of skills. These effects, acting in tandem with other processes such as differential neural development, may help to explain common links between early condition and future fitness.},

It is impossible simply to choose a domain and have it naturally follow which data standards should be used in all cases. The ‘right’ standards to use is often dependent on the use case scenarios for a given project. Potential downstream applications for the data, however, may not always be apparent at the time the data are generated. Similarly, technology evolves, adding further complexity. Would-be standards adopters must strike a balance between planning for the future and minimizing the burden of compliance. Better tools and resources are required to help guide this balancing act.},

Disruption in {IFT} and cilia function causes several human disorders, including polycystic kidneys, retinal dystrophy, neurosensory impairment, and Bardet-Biedl syndrome ({BBS).} To uncover new ciliary components, including {IFT} proteins, we compared C. elegans ciliated neuronal and nonciliated cells through serial analysis of gene expression ({SAGE)} and screened for genes potentially regulated by the ciliogenic transcription factor, {DAF-19.} Using these complementary approaches, we identified numerous candidate ciliary genes and confirmed the ciliated-cell-specific expression of 14 novel genes. One of these, {C27H5.7a}, encodes a ciliary protein that undergoes {IFT.} As with other {IFT} proteins, its ciliary localization and transport is disrupted by mutations in {IFT} and bbs genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ciliary structural defect of C. elegans dyf-13(mn396) mutants is caused by a mutation in {C27H5.7a.} Together, our findings help define a ciliary transcriptome and suggest that {DYF-13}, an evolutionarily conserved protein, is a novel core {IFT} component required for cilia function.},

These “high-grade” lesions make up approximately one quarter of medulloblastomas, and recur and metastasize more frequently than tumors lacking anaplasia. We believe anaplastic change represents a type of malignant progression common to many medulloblastoma subtypes and to other {CNS} embryonal lesions as well. Correlation of these histological changes with the accumulation of genetic events suggests a model for the histological and molecular progression of medulloblastoma.},

In the absence of intensity gradient, using a light beam to pull a particle backwards is counter intuitive. Here, we show that it is possible to realize a backward scattering force which pulls a particle all the way towards the source without an equilibrium point. The underlining physics is the maximization of forward scattering via interference of the radiation multipoles. We show explicitly that the necessary condition to realize a negative (pulling) optical force is the simultaneous excitation of multipoles in the particle and if the projection of the total photon momentum along the propagation direction is small (as in some propagation invariant beams), attractive optical force is possible. This possibility adds "pulling" as an additional degree of freedom to optical micromanipulation.},

	abstract = {Since the 1660’s the scientific method has included reproducibility as a mainstay in its effort to root error from scientific discovery. With the explosive growth of digitization in scientific research and communication, it is easier than ever to satisfy this requirement. In computational research experimental details and methods can be recorded in code and scripts, data is digital, papers are frequently online, and the result is the potential for “really reproducible research.”  Imagine the ability to routinely inspect code and data and recreate others’ results: Every step taken to achieve the findings can potentially be transparent. Now imagine anyone with an Internet connection and the capability of running the code being able to do {this.This} paper investigates the obstacles blocking the sharing of code and data to understand conditions under which computational scientists reveal their full research compendium. A survey of registrants at a top machine learning conference ({NIPS)} was used to discover the strength of underlying factors that affect the decision to reveal code, data, and ideas. Sharing of code and data is becoming more common as about a third of respondents post some on their websites, and about 85\% self report to have some code or data publicly available on the web. Contrary to theoretical expectations, the decision to share work is grounded in communitarian norms, although when work remains hidden private incentives dominate the decision. We find that code, data, and ideas are each regarded differently in terms of how they are revealed and that guidance from scientific norms varies with pervasiveness of computation in the field. The largest barriers to sharing are time involved in preparation of work and the legal Intellectual Property framework scientists {face.This} paper does two things. It provides evidence in the debate about whether scientists’ research revealing behavior is wholly governed by considerations of personal impact or whether the reasoning behind the revealing decision involves larger scientific ideals, and secondly, this research describes the actual sharing behavior in the Machine Learning community.},

	abstract = {Podocytes are specialized epithelial cells of the glomerulus in the kidney, which interconnect at the top of the glomerular basement membrane through the slit diaphragm, an adherens-like junction that plays a crucial role in the glomerular filtration process. Podocin, a plasma membrane anchored stomatin-like protein, is expressed in lipid rafts at the insertion of the slit diaphragm in podocytes. Mutations in {NPHS2}, the gene encoding podocin, are associated with inherited and sporadic cases of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. Here, we show that brefeldin A induces accumulation of newly synthesized podocin in the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting that podocin biosynthesis follows the classical secretory pathway, and we study the effect of 12 {NPHS2} mutations associated with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome on the trafficking of the protein. We found that 9 podocin mutants were not targeted to the plasma membrane, 8 being retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and one being localized in late endosomes. Furthermore, by screening our database of patients with {NPHS2} mutations, we found that podocin mutants retained in the endoplasmic reticulum are associated with earlier onset of the disease than those correctly targeted to the cell membrane. Our data suggest that most of {NPHS2} mutations lead to retention of podocin in the endoplasmic reticulum and therefore provide a rationale for devising therapeutic approaches aimed at correcting the protein processing defect.},

Members of the {DEG/ENaC} family expressed in epithelial tissues are called {ENaCs} and mediate Na(+) transport across epithelia. {ENaCs} exhibit constitutive activity and strict Na(+) selectivity. We report here the analysis of the first {DEG/ENaC} in Caenorhabditis elegans with functional features of {ENaCs} that is involved in sensory perception. {ACD-1} (acid-sensitive channel, degenerin-like) is constitutively open and impermeable to Ca(2+), yet it is required with neuronal {DEG/ENaC} channel {DEG-1} for acid avoidance and chemotaxis to the amino acid lysine. Surprisingly, we document that {ACD-1} is required in glia rather than neurons to orchestrate sensory perception. We also report that {ACD-1} is inhibited by extracellular and intracellular acidification and, based on the analysis of an acid-hypersensitive {ACD-1} mutant, we propose a mechanism of action of {ACD-1} in sensory responses based on its sensitivity to protons. Our findings suggest that channels with {ACD-1} features may be expressed in mammalian glia and have important functions in controlling neuronal function.},

	abstract = {In Caenorhabditis elegans, the gene unc-1 controls anesthetic sensitivity and normal locomotion. The protein {UNC-1} is a close homolog of the mammalian protein stomatin and is expressed primarily in the nervous system. Genetic studies in C. elegans have shown that the {UNC-1} protein interacts with a sodium channel subunit, {UNC-8.} In humans, absence of stomatin is associated with abnormal sodium and potassium levels in red blood cells. Stomatin also has been postulated to participate in the formation of lipid rafts, which are membrane microdomains associated with protein complexes, cholesterol, and sphingolipids. In this study, we isolated a low-density, detergent-resistant fraction from cell membranes of C. elegans. This fraction contains cholesterol, sphingolipids, and protein consistent with their identification as lipid rafts. We then probed Western blots of protein from the rafts and found that the {UNC-1} protein is almost totally restricted to this fraction. The {UNC-8} protein is also found in rafts and coimmunoprecipitates {UNC-1.} A second stomatin-like protein, {UNC-24}, also affects anesthetic sensitivity, is found in lipid rafts, and regulates {UNC-1} distribution. Mutations in the unc-24 gene alter the distribution of {UNC-1} in lipid rafts. Each of these mutations alters anesthetic sensitivity in C. elegans. Because lipid rafts contain many of the putative targets of volatile anesthetics, they may represent a novel class of targets for volatile anesthetics.},

	abstract = {With the rise of electronic publishing and the inherent paradigm shifts for so many other scientific endeavours, it is time to consider a change in the practices of scholarly publication in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. To facilitate the speed and quality of science, the future of scholarly communication will rest on four pillars - an ecosystem of scholarly products, immediate and open access, open peer review, and full recognition for participating in the process. These four pillars enable us to build better tools to facilitate the discovery of new relevant work for individual scientists, one of the greatest challenges of our time as we cope with the current deluge of scientific information. By incorporating these principles into future publication platforms, we argue that science and society will be better served than by remaining locked into a publication formula that arose in the 1600s. It has served its purpose admirably and well, but it is time to move forward. With the rise of the Internet, scholarly publishing has embraced electronic distribution. But the tools afforded by the Internet and other advancing technologies have profound implications for scholarly communication beyond just distribution. We argue that, to best serve science, the process of scholarly communication must embrace these advances and evolve. Here we consider the current state of the process in ecology and evolutionary biology and propose directions for change. We identify four pillars for the future of scientific communication: (1) an ecosystem of scholarly products; (2) immediate and open access; (3) open peer review; and (4) full recognition for participating in the process. These four pillars will guide the development of better tools and practices for discovering and sharing scientific knowledge in a modern networked world. Things were far different when the existing system arose in the 1600s, and though it has served its purpose admirably and well, it is time to move forward.},

	abstract = {Taking advantage of the recent availability of the whole genome sequence of Caenorhabditis briggsae, a closely related nematode to Caenorhabditis elegans, we have examined the chemosensory gene superfamily by using comparative genomic methods. We have identified a chemosensory gene family, serpentine receptor class ab (srab), which exists in both species with 25 members in C. elegans and 14 members in C. briggsae. More than 20\% of these gene models are reannotated. The srab family is similar to, but distinct from, the previously described serpentine receptor class a (sra) family and shows a differential expansion in C. elegans similar to that previously described for sra. The cellular expression patterns for multiple members of the srab family in both phasmid neurons in the tail and amphid neurons in the head supports the conclusion that they are chemosensory genes and suggests that they may play a role in integrating chemosensory inputs from both ends of the organism. The expansion of both the srab and sra gene families in C. elegans relative to C. briggsae is due to multiple rounds of tandem duplication and translocation of individual genes.},

	abstract = {A reverse genetics approach was utilized to discover new proteins that interact with the mitochondrial fusion mediator mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) and that may participate in mitochondrial fusion. In particular, in vivo formaldehyde cross-linking of whole {HeLa} cells and immunoprecipitation with purified Mfn2 antibodies of {SDS} cell lysates were used to detect an approximately 42-{kDa} protein. This protein was identified by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry as stomatin-like protein 2 (Stoml2), previously described as a peripheral plasma membrane protein of unknown function associated with the cytoskeleton of erythrocytes (Wang, Y., and Morrow, J. S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 8062-8071). Immunoblot analysis with anti-Stoml2 antibodies showed that Stoml2 could be immunoprecipitated specifically with Mfn2 antibody either from formaldehyde-cross-linked and {SDS-lysed} cells or from cells lysed with digitonin. Subsequent immunocytochemistry and cell fractionation experiments fully supported the conclusion that Stoml2 is indeed a mitochondrial protein. Furthermore, demonstration of mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent import of Stoml2 accompanied by proteolytic processing, together with the results of sublocalization experiments, suggested that Stoml2 is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane and faces the intermembrane space. Notably, formaldehyde cross-linking revealed a "ladder" of high molecular weight protein species, indicating the presence of high molecular weight Stoml2-Mfn2 hetero-oligomers. Knockdown of Stoml2 by the short interfering {RNA} approach showed a reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential, without, however, any obvious changes in mitochondrial morphology.},

For data to be available, researchers must be willing and able to share them. The policies of governments, funding agencies, journals, and university tenure and promotion committees also influence how, when, and whether research data are shared. Data are complex objects. Their purposes and the methods by which they are produced vary widely across scientific fields, as do the criteria for sharing them. To address these challenges, it is necessary to examine the arguments for sharing data and how those arguments match the motivations and interests of the scientific community and the public. Four arguments are examined: to make the results of publicly funded data available to the public, to enable others to ask new questions of extant data, to advance the state of science, and to reproduce research. Libraries need to consider their role in the face of each of these arguments, and what expertise and systems they require for data curation.},

Our genetic analysis shows that {UNC-31} and neuronal Gαs are different parts of the same pathway and that the {UNC-31/Gαs} pathway is functionally distinct from the presynaptic Gαq pathway with which it interacts. {UNC-31} acts upstream of Gαs because mutations that activate the Gαs pathway confer similar levels of strongly hyperactive, coordinated locomotion in both unc-31 null and (+) backgrounds. Using cell-specific promoters, we show that both {UNC-31} and the Gαs pathway function in cholinergic motor neurons to regulate locomotion rate. Using immunostaining we show that {UNC-31} is often concentrated at or near active zones of cholinergic motor neuron synapses. Our data suggest that presynaptic {UNC-31} activity, likely acting via dense-core vesicle exocytosis, is required to locally activate the neuronal Gαs pathway near synaptic active zones.},

In some cases of this anaemia, in which the red cells leak sodium and potassium ions, this protein is absent from the membrane, immediately suggesting that it has a role in the regulation of ion transport. The protein has a single hydrophobic domain, presumed to be membrane-associated, is phosphorylated, and is widely distributed in animal tissues. Mutations of a homologue in sensory nerve cells of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans disrupt a neuronal transduction mechanism, in which mechanosensory information is relayed to an ion channel, whose opening initiates an action potential. It could be that this protein is a molecular link in a genetic stretch-sensitive system. Abnormalities of red cell ion transport are well known in human hypertension, but the molecular basis has never been elucidated: this protein and its functional associates, operating in a stretch- or pressure-sensitive complex, might be important.},

Ursids have proportionally smaller canines than other large carnivores with a specialized feeding ecology, such as large felids, and the upper canine morphology is both canid-like and felid-like. The giant panda is the most divergent species, and its short, blunt, and cone-like canines appear well adapted for tearing into bamboo. The almost equally herbivorous spectacled bear has a less derived canine morphology. The large canines of the sun bear are divergent from other ursine ursids, and may be an adaptation for tearing open tree trunks in search of insects. Discriminant Analysis is successful in separating ursid species on the basis of canine morphology, but the canines of ursine ursids, and also of the spectacled bear, show greater resemblance among the species than the marked differences in feeding ecology would suggest. This could be in part due to a short evolutionary history, and in part due to canines not having been subjected to much evolutionary selection as has been the case among other large carnivores, such as large felids. Ursids are probably evolutionarily and ecologically successful due to physical size and strength rather than a derived craniodental anatomy. J. Morphol., 2008. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Genes necessary for this induction include the lin-3 growth factor, the let-23 receptor tyrosine kinase, and let-60 ras. lin-15 is a negative regulator of this inductive pathway. In lin-15 mutant animals, all six {VPCs} adopt vulval fates, even in the absence of inductive signal. Previous genetic studies suggested that lin-15 is a complex locus with two independently mutable activities, A and B. We have cloned the lin-15 locus by germline transformation and find that it encodes two nonoverlapping transcripts that are transcribed in the same direction. The downstream transcript encodes the lin-{15A} function; the upstream transcript encodes the lin-{15B} function. The predicted lin-{15A} and lin-{15B} proteins are novel and hydrophilic. We have identified a molecular null allele of lin-15 and have used it to analyze the role of lin-15 in the signaling pathway.

	abstract = {Ecological databases continue to grow in volume, breadth and complexity. Higher level descriptions of data (i.e., metadata) and information derived from subsequent data processing and analyses (i.e., “meta-information” in the broadest sense) are essential for understanding and using the increasingly complex and voluminous data and information. The concepts of meta-information, in general, and metadata, in particular, have evolved in concert with the increasing needs for functionality by the community. From a scientific perspective, metadata may be characterized as having developed from initially supporting data discovery; to facilitating acquisition, comprehension and utilization of data by humans; and, most recently, to beginning to enable automated data discovery, ingestion, processing and analysis via metadata-enabled scientific workflow systems. The continued conceptual and operational developments in metadata required to support comprehensive automated scientific workflow systems portend many challenges and opportunities. For example, there are significant opportunities for collaboration among ecologists and computer scientists in developing domain-specific controlled vocabularies and ontologies that provide the basis for semantic mediation—the “glue” technologies that enable automated data discovery, ingestion, processing and analysis. Similarly, there are opportunities for computer scientists and engineers to develop new mechanisms that support automated metadata encoding—such as providing the information that would be necessary to understand the end-to-end flow of sensor data from in situ data collection, streaming through quality assurance filtering, aggregation, transformation and additional processing, analysis, and publication of digital products. As the technologies mature, we still have many sociological barriers to overcome including the needs for increased attention to software usability testing and engineering to enhance user-friendliness of metadata management software, new capital investments in ecological data archives, and increasing the metadata management benefit–cost ratio for the average scientist via incentives and enabling tools.},

	abstract = {We identify and characterize two matrix (m)-{AAA} proteases ({AtFtsH3} and {AtFtsH10)} present in the mitochondria of Arabidopsis thaliana. {AtFtsH3} is the predominant protease in leaves of wild type plants. Both proteases assemble with prohibitins ({PHBs)} into high molecular weight complexes (approximately 2 {MDa)}, similarly to their yeast counterparts. A smaller {PHB} complex (approximately 1 {MDa)}, without the m-{AAA} proteases, was also detected. Unlike in yeast, stable prohibitin-independent high molecular weight assemblies of m-{AAA} proteases could not be identified in A. thaliana. {AtFtsH3} and {AtFtsH10} form at least two types of m-{AAA-PHB} complexes in wild type plants. The one type contains {PHBs} and {AtFtsH3}, and the second one is composed of {PHBs} and both {AtFtsH3} and {AtFtsH10.} Complexes composed of {PHBs} and {AtFtsH10} were found in an Arabidopsis mutant lacking {AtFtsH3} (ftsh3). Thus, both {AtFtsH3} and {AtFtsH10} may form hetero- and homo-oligomeric complexes with prohibitins. The increased level of {AtFtsH10} observed in ftsh3 suggests that functions of the homo- and hetero-oligomeric complexes containing {AtFtsH3} can be at least partially substituted by {AtFtsH10} homo-oligomers. The steady-state level of the {AtFtsH10} transcripts did not change in ftsh3 compared with wild type plants, but we found that almost twice more of the {AtFtsH10} transcripts were associated with polysomes in ftsh3. Based on this result, we assume that the {AtFtsH10} protein is synthesized at a higher rate in the ftsh3 mutant. Our results provide the first data on the composition of m-{AAA} and {PHB} complexes in plant mitochondria and suggest that the abundance of m-{AAA} proteases is regulated not only at the transcriptional but also at the translational level.},

	abstract = {Prohibitins ({PHBs)} 1 and 2 are small conserved proteins implicated in a number of functions in the mitochondrion, as well as in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. The current understanding of {PHB} functions comes from studies of model organisms such as yeast, worm and mouse, but considerable debate remains with regard to the primary functions of these ubiquitous proteins. We exploit the tractable reverse genetics of Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, in order to specifically analyse the function of {PHB} in this highly divergent eukaryote. Using inducible {RNA} interference ({RNAi)} we show that {PHB1} is essential in T. brucei, where it is confined to the cell's single mitochondrion forming a high molecular weight complex. {PHB1} and {PHB2} appear to be indispensible for mitochondrial translation. Their ablation leads to a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, however no effect on the level of reactive oxygen species was observed. Flagellates lacking either {PHB1} or both {PHB1} and {PHB2} exhibit significant morphological changes of their organelle, most notably its inflation. Even long after the loss of the {PHB} proteins, {mtDNA} was unaltered and mitochondrial cristae remained present, albeit displaced to the periphery of the mitochondrion, which is in contrast to other eukaryotes.},

The authors advocate for {“Publishing”} data sets, with a capital {“P.”} This is in contrast to simple data publishing on the internet with little to no regard to accuracy and metadata. Publishing (with the capital {“P”)} ensures the data is accurate and reliable. This must be accomplished by a data peer review system. This peer review system is described as “a procedure which allows the community to make assertions about the trustworthiness and fitness for purpose of the data.” This method of peer reviewing data sets is used by some data journals, such as Earth System Science Data.
The authors attempt to answer the question, {“What} exactly is peer review of data?” They argue that there are similar requirements for data peer review as with article peer review. The main things that must be checked are the metadata (for completeness), the data’s internal consistency, the merits of algorithms and equations used, and judgments of the data’s importance and potential impact. The authors then provide a data review checklist with items relating to metadata, data quality, and general characteristics.
The authors end with yet another recommendation for citation of data sets. The competing recommendations for data citation indicate a standard is sorely needed. The authors’ recommendation contains many of the same items suggested in other citation recommendations, but add “extent,” “availability,” and “language.”

Several, otherwise recessive alleles of some of these genes act as dominant enhancer mutations of temperature-sensitive alleles of mec-4, mec-5, mec-6, mec-12, and mec-15. Screens for additional dominant enhancers of mec-4 and mec-5 yielded mutations in previously known genes. In addition, some mec-7 alleles showed allele-specific, dominant suppression of the mec-15 touch-insensitive (Mec) phenotype. The dominant enhancement and suppression exhibited by these mutations suggest that the products of several touch genes interact. These results are consistent with a model, supported by the known sequences of these genes, that almost all of the touch function genes contribute to the mechanosensory apparatus.},

The current version provides support to experimental scientists to access their raw data, facility managers for accounting for facility usage and other scientists who wish to re-use raw experimental data. In this paper, extensions to the {CSMD} are presented to describe the analysis process so that the provenance of the derived data can be captured.

Genetic epistasis studies using Gαq gain-of-function and null mutations, along with a mutation that blocks synaptic vesicle priming and the synaptic vesicle priming stimulator phorbol ester, suggest that the Gαq pathway generates the core, obligatory signals for synaptic vesicle priming. In contrast, the Gαs pathway is not required for the core priming function, because steady-state levels of neurotransmitter release are not significantly altered in animals lacking a neuronal Gαs pathway, even though these animals are strongly paralyzed as a result of functional (nondevelopmental) defects. However, our genetic analysis indicates that these two functionally distinct pathways converge and that they do so downstream of {DAG} production. Further linking the two pathways, our epistasis analysis of a ric-8 null mutant suggests that {RIC-8} (a receptor-independent Gα guanine nucleotide exchange factor) is required to maintain both the Gαq vesicle priming pathway and the neuronal Gαs pathway in a functional state. We propose that the neuronal Gαs pathway transduces critical positional information onto the core Gαq pathway to stabilize the priming of selected synapses that are optimal for locomotion.},

	abstract = {We measured basal metabolic rate ({BMR)} and total evaporative water loss ({TEWL)} of species of foxes that exist on the Arabian Peninsula, Blanford’s fox (Vulpes cana) and two subspecies of Red fox (Vulpes vulpes). Combining these data with that on other canids from the literature, we searched for specialization of physiological traits among desert foxes using both conventional least squares regression and regressions based on phylogenetic independent contrasts. Further, we explored the consequences of reduced body size of foxes on life history parameters such as litter size and neonate mass. For Blanford’s foxes, Red foxes from the central desert of Arabia, and Red foxes from the more mesic Asir mountains, body mass averaged 1,285±52 g, 1,967±289 g, and 3,060±482 g, respectively, whereas mean {BMR}, during summer, was 304.5±32.3 {kJ/day}, 418.0±32.4 {kJ/day}, and 724.1±120.2 {kJ/day} ({±SD).} An analysis of covariance with body mass as a covariate showed no statistical differences in {BMR} among foxes. Analysis of covariance indicated that Red fox from the Asir mountains had a higher {TEWL} than Red foxes from central Arabia or than Blanford’s foxes also from the mountains. Comparisons of all species of desert and mesic foxes showed no significant differences in {BMR}, nor did desert foxes have a significantly lower {BMR} than other carnivores. {TEWL} of desert foxes was lower than other more mesic carnivores; deviations in {TEWL} ranged from −17.7\% for the Fennec fox (Fennecus zerda) to −57.4\% for the Kit fox (Vulpes velox). Although desert foxes have a {BMR} comparable to other more mesic species, it appears that desert foxes do have a smaller body mass, lowering overall energy requirements. We attribute this reduction in body size to the “resource limitation hypothesis” whereby natural selection favors smaller individuals in a resource-limited environment, especially during periods of severe food shortage. However, until common garden experiments are performed, developmental plasticity and acclimation cannot be ruled out as contributors to this pattern.},

Using melanogenin bound to an affinity matrix and amino acid sequencing, we identified the mitochondrial protein, prohibitin, as an intracellular binding target. Studies employing {siRNA} demonstrate that prohibitin is required for melanogenin to exert its propigmentary effects and reveal an unsuspected functional role for this protein in melanin induction. This represents a mechanism by which propigmentary signals are transduced and ultimately provides a potential target for the treatment of pigmentary disorders.},

Turns and reversals occur at stable frequencies but irregular intervals, producing probabilistic exploratory behaviors. Here we dissect the roles of individual sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons in exploratory behaviors under different conditions. After animals are removed from bacterial food, they initiate a local search behavior consisting of reversals and deep omega-shaped turns triggered by {AWC} olfactory neurons, {ASK} gustatory neurons, and {AIB} interneurons. Over the following 30 min, the animals disperse as reversals and omega turns are suppressed by {ASI} gustatory neurons and {AIY} interneurons. Interneurons and motor neurons downstream of {AIB} and {AIY} encode specific aspects of reversal and turn frequency, amplitude, and directionality. {SMD} motor neurons help encode the steep amplitude of omega turns, {RIV} motor neurons specify the ventral bias of turns that follow a reversal, and {SMB} motor neurons set the amplitude of sinusoidal movement. Many of these sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons are also implicated in chemotaxis and thermotaxis. Thus, this circuit may represent a common substrate for multiple navigation behaviors.},

Proponents of the data-sharing movement have advocated the citation of datasets in order to recognize contributions and enhance access. This study examines a sample of papers from the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research ({ICPSR)} Bibliography of Data-Related Literature that are based on secondary analysis of datasets available in the {ICPSR} data archive to determine the data citation practices of authors. The results indicate that many authors fail to cite the data used in secondary analysis studies. Possible reasons for the dismal state of data citation practices are considered, including the recent introduction of data into the scholarly record and its marginalization as an information format. Updating citation practices to include datasets will support data sharing and foster responsible scholarship.},

Moreover, sequence conflicts appear in several databases. It was the aim of the study to further describe {SLP-2} primary sequence and to solve existing sequence conflicts. For this purpose a protein extract was run on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and {SLP-2} was identified by {MALDI-TOF/TOF.} {SLP-2} was digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, Lys-C, and de novo sequencing studies as well as Nano-{HPLC-ESI-MS/MS} analysis were carried out. By the use of several proteases sequence coverage of 90\% was obtained but the N-terminal 34 amino acids harbouring database conflict 1 were not covered. The presence of Leucine 129 (sequence conflict 2) and Alanine 202 (sequence conflict 3) was verified by three independent approaches. High sequence coverage resulting from multiple proteolytic cleavage, {MALDI-TOF/TOF}, Nano-{HPLC-ESI-MS/MS} and de novo sequencing completed unambiguous analysis of {SLP-2} primary structure of approximately = 90\% of sequence coverage. In addition, methodology used was able to solve so far pending sequence conflicts in databases and literature. {SLP-2} is a high abundance protein in several tissues and cells and may play an important biological role and therefore characterization of its primary structure is of importance.},

The mutation detection rate was 43\% for familial {AR} and 10.5\% for sporadic {SRNS}, confirming genetic heterogeneity. No pathogenic {NPHS2} mutations were found in {DMS} patients. Age at onset in patients with two pathogenic mutations was earlier, especially in cases with frameshift, truncating, and the {R138Q} missense mutations. Patients with only one {NPHS2} mutation or variant had late-onset {NS.} Triallelic inheritance was observed in one patient with a homozygous {R138Q} mutation and a de novo {NPHS1} mutation. Among 32 patients with two {NPHS2} mutations who underwent kidney transplantation, only one developed late recurrence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ({FSGS).} Among 25 patients with sporadic {SRNS} and post-transplantation recurrence, we detected a heterozygous {NPHS2} mutation in one case, and heterozygous variants/polymorphisms in 3 cases. {CONCLUSION:} Patients with two pathogenic {NPHS2} mutations present with early-onset {SRNS} and very low incidence of post-transplantation recurrence. Heterozygous {NPHS2} variants may play a role in atypical cases with mild, late-onset course, and recurrence after transplantation.},

I suggest a five-point scale for each, by which a journal article can be evaluated, and provide diagrammatic representations for such evaluations. While the criteria adopted for these scales are somewhat arbitrary, and while the rating of a particular article on each axis may involve elements of subjective judgment, these Five Stars of Online Journal Articles provide a conceptual framework by which to judge the degree to which any article achieves or falls short of the ideal, which should be useful to authors, editors and publishers.

	abstract = {Because microtubules perform many essential functions in neurons, delineating unique roles attributable to these organelles presents a formidable challenge. Microtubules endow neurons with shape and structure and are required for developmental processes including neurite outgrowth, intracellular transport, and synapse formation and plasticity; microtubules in sensory neurons may be required for the above processes in addition to a specific sensory function. In Caenorhabditis elegans, six touch receptor neurons ({TRNs)} sense gentle touch and uniquely contain 15-protofilament microtubules. Disruption of these microtubules by loss of either the {MEC-7} beta-tubulin or {MEC-12} alpha-tubulin or by growth in 1 {mM} colchicine causes touch insensitivity, altered distribution of the touch transduction channel, and a general reduction in protein levels. We show that the effect on touch sensitivity can be separated from the others; microtubule depolymerization in mature {TRNs} causes touch insensitivity but does not result in protein distribution and production defects. In addition, the mec-12(e1605) mutation selectively causes touch insensitivity without affecting microtubule formation and other cellular processes. Touching e1605 animals produces a reduced mechanoreceptor current that inactivates more rapidly than in wild-type, suggesting a specific role of the microtubules in mechanotransduction.},

Mutations of {NPHS1} or {NPHS2}, the genes encoding for nephrin and podocin, lead to early onset of heavy proteinuria, and rapid progression to end-stage renal disease, suggesting that both proteins are essential for the integrity of the glomerular filter. Podocin is a stomatin protein family member with a predicted hairpin-like structure localizing to the insertion site of the slit diaphragm of podocytes, the visceral glomerular epithelial cells of the kidney. Here we investigate the pathomechanisms of different disease-causing podocin mutations. We show that wild-type podocin is targeted to the plasma membrane, and forms homo-oligomers involving the carboxy and amino terminal cytoplasmic domains. The association of podocin with specialized lipid raft microdomains of the plasma membrane was a prerequisite for recruitment of nephrin into rafts. In contrast, disease-causing mutations of podocin ({R138Q} and {R138X)} failed to recruit nephrin into rafts either because these mutants were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum ({R138Q)}, or because they failed to associate with rafts ({R138X)} despite their presence in the plasma membrane. None of the mutants did augment nephrin signaling, suggesting that lipid raft targeting facilitates nephrin signaling. Our findings demonstrate that the failure of mutant podocin to recruit nephrin into lipid rafts may be essential for the pathogenesis of {NPHS2.}},

Hybridization with a probe which specifically hybridizes with the rat {SCP-2-related} {cDNA} encoding rat {SCP-x} reveals that the 2.2- and 3.0-kb transcripts encode mouse {SCP-x.} {SCP-x} transcripts are expressed predominantly in the liver, but low-level expression can be demonstrated in all tissues analyzed. Isolation and characterization of two overlapping {SCP-x} {cDNAs} indicate that the {cDNAs} are derived from alternatively polyadenylated transcripts spanning approx. 2.2 and approx. 2.9 kb. Nucleotide sequencing reveals that the predicted {ORF}, which consists of 547 codons, is composed of 143 C-terminal amino acids which are essentially identical with mouse pre-{SCP-2} and 404 N-terminal residues which are specific for {SCP-x.} To date, it is not clear if all {SCP-2-related} transcripts are transcribed from a single gene. We have isolated a genomic clone containing an {SCP-2-related} pseudogene which has some of the characteristics expected for a truncated processed pseudogene. Therefore, our results indicate that at least some of the multiple restriction fragments which are detected by Southern hybridization analyses with {SCP-x} {cDNA-derived} probes can be explained by cross-hybridization with a pseudogene.},

Although it is now accepted that data should be made available on request, the current regulations regarding the availability of software are inconsistent. We argue that, with some exceptions, anything less than the release of source programs is intolerable for results that depend on computation. The vagaries of hardware, software and natural language will always ensure that exact reproducibility remains uncertain, but withholding code increases the chances that efforts to reproduce results will fail.},

	abstract = {We recently cloned a novel gene, {NPHS2}, involved in autosomal recessive steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome. This gene encodes a novel podocyte protein, podocin. Given its similarity with the stomatin family proteins, podocin is predicted to be an integral membrane protein with a single membrane domain forming a hairpin-like structure placing both N- and C-termini in the cytosol. Here, we show by in situ hybridization, that during development, the {NPHS2} transcript is first expressed in mesonephric podocytes from the S-shaped body and, later, in the metanephric kidney, in the future podocytes at the late S-shaped body stage. In the mature kidney, {NPHS2} is exclusively expressed in the podocytes of mature glomeruli. We generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies against fusion proteins derived from the N- and the C-terminal regions of podocin which detected a single band of 49-kd in transfected {HEK293} cell lysates by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. By immunohistology, podocin was detected in podocytes from the early capillary loop stage in the developing nephrons, and at the basal pole, along the {GBM}, in mature glomeruli. By electron microscopy, we demonstrate that podocin is facing the slit diaphragm with its two ends in the cytoplasm of the foot processes, in agreement with its predicted structure. Our results suggest that podocin could serve to anchor directly or indirectly components of the slit diaphragm to the cytoskeleton.},

	abstract = {Sterol carrier protein-2 ({SCP-2)} is an intracellular, small, basic protein domain that in vitro enhances the transfer of lipids between membranes. It is expressed in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. There are five human genes, {HSD17B4}, {SCPX}, {HSDL2} {STOML1}, and C20orf79, which encode {SCP-2.} {HSD17B4}, {SCPX}, {HSDL2}, and {STOML1} encode fusion proteins with {SCP-2} downstream of another protein domain, whereas C20orf79 encodes an unfused {SCP-2.} We have extracted {SCP-2} domains from databases and analyzed the evolution of the eukaryotic {SCP-2.} We show that {SCPX} and {HSDL2} are present in most animals from Cnidaria to Chordata. {STOML1} are present in nematodes and more advanced animals. {HSD17B4} which encodes a D-bifunctional protein ({DBP)} with domains for D-3-hydroxyacyl-{CoA} dehydrogenase, enoyl-{CoA} hydratase, and {SCP-2} are found in animals from insects to mammals and also in fungi. Nematodes, amoebas, ciliates, apicomplexans, and oomycetes express an alternative {DBP} with the {SCP-2} domain directly connected to the D-3-hydroxyacyl-{CoA} dehydrogenase. This fusion has not been retained in plant genomes, which solely express unfused {SCP-2} domains. Proteins carrying unfused {SCP-2} domains are also encoded in bacteria, archaea, ciliates, fungi, insects, nematodes, and vertebrates. Our results indicate that the fusion between D-3-hydroxyacyl-{CoA} dehydrogenase and {SCP-2} was formed early during eukaryotic evolution. There have since been several gene fission events where genes encoding unfused {SCP-2} domains have been formed, as well as gene fusion events placing the {SCP-2} domain in novel protein domain contexts.},

	abstract = {Volatile anesthetics like halothane and enflurane are of interest to clinicians and neuroscientists because of their ability to preferentially disrupt higher functions that make up the conscious state. All volatiles were once thought to act identically; if so, they should be affected equally by genetic variants. However, mutations in two distinct genes, one in Caenorhabditis and one in Drosophila, have been reported to produce much larger effects on the response to halothane than enflurane [1, 2]. To see whether this anesthesia signature is adventitious or fundamental, we have identified orthologs of each gene and determined the mutant phenotype within each species. The fly gene, narrow abdomen (na), encodes a putative ion channel whose sequence places it in a unique family; the nematode gene, unc-79, is identified here as encoding a large cytosolic protein that lacks obvious motifs. In Caenorhabditis, mutations that inactivate both of the na orthologs produce an Unc-79 phenotype; in Drosophila, mutations that inactivate the unc-79 ortholog produce an na phenotype. In each organism, studies of double mutants place the genes in the same pathway, and biochemical studies show that proteins of the {UNC-79} family control {NA} protein levels by a posttranscriptional mechanism. Thus, the anesthetic signature reflects an evolutionarily conserved role for the na orthologs, implying its intimate involvement in drug action.},

Like many other olfactory mutants, they retain responses to high concentrations of {AWC-sensed} odors; we show here that these residual responses are caused by the ability of other olfactory neurons (the {AWA} neurons) to be recruited at high odor concentrations. odr-2 encodes a membrane-associated protein related to the Ly-6 superfamily of {GPI-linked} signaling proteins and is the founding member of a C. elegans gene family with at least seven other members. Alternative splicing of odr-2 yields three predicted proteins that differ only at the extreme amino terminus. The three isoforms have different promoters, and one isoform may have a unique role in olfaction. An epitope-tagged {ODR-2} protein is expressed at high levels in sensory neurons, motor neurons, and interneurons and is enriched in axons. The {AWC} neurons are superficially normal in their development and structure in odr-2 mutants, but their function is impaired. Our results suggest that {ODR-2} may regulate {AWC} signaling within the neuronal network required for chemotaxis.},

	abstract = {Although nematodes like Caenorhabditis elegans are incapable of de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, they can utilize nonfunctional sterols by converting them into cholesterol and other sterols for cellular function. The results reported previously and presented here suggest that blocking of sterol conversion to cholesterol in C. elegans by 25-azacoprostane-{HCl} (azacoprostane) treatment causes a serious defect in germ cell development, growth, cuticle development, and motility behavior. To establish a biochemical basis for these physiological abnormalities, we performed proteomic analysis of mixed stage worms that had been treated with the drug. Our results from a differential display proteomic analysis revealed significant decreases in the levels of proteins involved in collagen and cytoskeleton organization such as protein disulfide isomerase (6.7-fold), beta-tubulin (5.41-fold), and {NEX-1} protein ({\textgreater}30-fold). Also reduced were enzymes involved in energy production such as phosphoglycerate kinase (4.8-fold) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (8.5-fold), a target for antifilarial drugs such as azacoprostane. In particular, reductions in the expression of lipoprotein families such as vitellogenin-2 (7.7-fold) and vitellogenin-6 (5.4-fold) were prominent in the drug-treated worms, indicating that sterol metabolism disturbance caused by azacoprostane treatment is tightly coupled with suppression of the lipid transfer-related proteins at the protein level. However, competitive quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed that the transcriptional levels of vit-2, vit-6, and their receptors (e.g. rme-2 and lrp-1) in drug-treated worms were 3- to 5-fold higher than those in the untreated group, suggesting a presence of a sterol regulatory element-binding protein ({SREBP)-like} pathway in these genes. In fact, multiple predicted sterol regulatory elements or related regulatory sequences responding to sterols were found to be located at the 5'-flanking regions in vit-2 and lrp-1 genes, and their transcriptional activities fluctuated highly in response to changes in sterol concentration. Thus, many physiological abnormalities caused by azacoprostane-mediated sterol metabolism disturbance appear to be exerted at least in part through {SREBP} pathway in C. elegans.},

	abstract = {Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ({IP(3))} receptors are endoplasmic reticulum ({ER)} membrane calcium channels that, upon activation, become substrates for the {ER-associated} degradation ({ERAD)} pathway. While it is clear that {IP(3)} receptors are polyubiquitinated and are transferred to the proteasome by a p97-based complex, currently very little is known about the proteins that initially select activated {IP(3)} receptors for {ERAD.} Here, we have transfected {HeLa} cells to stably express m3 muscarinic receptors to allow for the study of {IP(3)} receptor {ERAD} in this cell type, and show that {IP(3)} receptors are polyubiquitinated and then degraded by the proteasome in response to carbachol, a muscarinic agonist. In seeking to identify proteins that mediate {IP(3)} receptor {ERAD} we found that both {SPFH1} and {SPFH2} (also known as erlin 1 and erlin 2), which exist as a hetero-oligomeric complex, rapidly associate with {IP(3)} receptors in a manner that precedes polyubiquitination and the association of p97. Suppression of {SPFH1} and {SPFH2} expression by {RNA} interference markedly inhibited carbachol-induced {IP(3)} receptor polyubiquitination and degradation, but did not affect carbachol-induced calcium mobilization or {IkappaBalpha} processing, indicating that the {SPFH1/2} complex is a key player in {IP(3)} receptor {ERAD}, acting at a step after {IP(3)} receptor activation, but prior to {IP(3)} receptor polyubiquitination. Suppression of {SPFH1} and {SPFH2} expression had only slight effects on the turnover of some exogenous model {ERAD} substrates, and had no effect on sterol-induced {ERAD} of endogenous 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-{CoA} reductase. Overall, these studies show that m3 receptor-expressing {HeLa} cells are a valuable system for studying {IP(3)} receptor {ERAD}, and suggest that the {SPFH1/2} complex is a factor that selectively mediates the {ERAD} of activated {IP(3)} receptors.},

Chemotaxis to volatile odorants requires different sensory neurons from chemotaxis to water-soluble attractants, indicating that C. elegans might have senses that correspond to smell and taste, respectively. Single neurons have complex sensory properties, since six distinguishable volatile odorants are sensed by only two types of sensory neurons. Chemotaxis to subsets of volatile odorants is disrupted by mutations in the odr genes, which might be involved in odorant sensation or signal transduction.},

They are highly conserved from flies to humans and have been implicated in axon regeneration and cell process and contact formation, possibly providing functional platforms for cell-signaling in neurons and other cell types. We analyzed reggie {mRNA} and protein expression patterns during early zebrafish development. All three zebrafish genes, re-1a, -2a, and -2b, span a considerably diverse set of expression patterns, and their proteins are induced maternally, showing ubiquitous expression at early stages. Although re-2a {mRNA} can be observed in differentiating neurons in the brain, spinal cord, and neurogenic placodes, re-2b is transcribed mainly in head mesoderm, in neural crest derivates, and along somite boundaries. re-1a {mRNA} is present at high levels in expression domains that overlap with the combined expression pattern of both re-2 genes except at the somites, where it complements the pattern of re-2b. Immunostaining on embryos reveals reggie protein localization at the cell membrane, at cell-cell contacts, and along all early axon tracts. The early phase of reggie expression suggests a basic and ubiquitous function during the first stages of embryogenesis and into the gastrula period. Upon segmentation, a second phase of expression shows distinctly localized expression patterns, indicating tissue-specific roles and an involvement of re-1a/re-2a in neural development.},

The authors suggest ways libraries can prepare for this changing landscape. This thought-provoking article poses pertinent questions libraries must ask themselves going forward. I will refer to this article in my future career as my library enters the world of data set collection and dissemination.
The authors identify five trends that indicate data is becoming more important. First, data is increasingly becoming a commodity. Second, legislative trends regarding copyright and fair use are becoming more important. Third, the growth and organization (or lack thereof) of data poses an interesting challenge, namely locating, accessing, and reusing data sets. Fourth, publishing companies are implementing policies regarding data sets associated with articles they publish. Last, public/private partnerships, such as the Human Genome Project, are being created that add value to and repackage data sets for commercial use.
The authors go on to discuss current business models for accessing data sets. Among the models they identify is the Institutional Membership Model, in which institutions pay a one-time fee for access to data sets. Another model is the Serials Continuation Model in which the institution acquires the data sets on {CD} or other physical media on a periodic basis. Limitations of this model are that users may not be able to access these data sets online or away from the institution. A third model the authors discuss is the One-Time Payment Model, which is similar to the way most academic libraries currently buy monographs. Under this model, the institution would purchase data sets when identified by researchers as helpful to their research. The authors then go on to discuss what they call transitional models, i.e., non-traditional models that may indicate a transition to a more well-defined model. The two transitional models identified are the Ad-Hoc Model and the lack of a model. Both of these, the authors claim, present opportunities for the libraries to develop a sustainable business model.
Continuing beyond these models, the authors identify potential questions libraries must consider in key parts of their functioning regarding data sets: budgeting, selection and evaluation, licensing, and negotiation. Libraries need to ask how they will appropriate money towards purchase of data sets. Regarding selection and evaluation, libraries need to determine which data sets they will acquire and collect and how they will determine their level of quality. Additionally, should libraries license access to the data sets they collect? If so, how would that work? Likewise, how will they manage interlibrary loan of data sets and potential liability?
Finally, the authors suggest that libraries can exert significant influence on the data set market by being proactive and collecting data sets “at the source,” i.e., from researchers within their institutions. Because of the trend of data sets becoming more important, we are likely to see more data sets being published. In my future career as a data curation librarian, I will encourage data set publication at my institution. This article provides a nice overview of the reasons why it is important.

Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum prohibitin complete {cDNAs} were isolated, and the expression pattern of prohibitin was examined using polyclonal antibodies raised against the Arabidopsis recombinant prohibitin expressed in Escherichia coli. A single immunoreactive protein was detected in various plant species and in all Arabidopsis organs examined. Subcellular fractionation using tobacco leaves revealed prohibitin in a mitochondrial-enriched fraction. Phylogenetic conservation of prohibitin's amino acid sequence and subcellular localization suggests a similar function in plants, yeast and mammals.},

	abstract = {The prion protein ({PrP)} has been implicated in many diverse functions, making it difficult to pinpoint its basic physiological role. Our most recent studies in zebrafish, mammalian and invertebrate cells indicate that {PrP} regulates cell-cell communication, as well cell-matrix interactions at focal adhesions. In addition, we previously have shown that upon antibody-mediated cross-linking, {PrP} can be induced to cluster in the preformed T-cell cap. Here we review these data and discuss how the spatial link between {PrP} and the microdomain-forming proteins reggie-1 (flotillin-2) and reggie-2 (flotillin-1) may contribute to {PrP} signaling, leading to the local assembly of membrane protein complexes at sites involved in cellular communication, such as cell-cell contacts, focal adhesions, the T-cell cap, and synapses.},

In the liver, deficient prohibitin activity participates in the progression of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and obesity, according to mechanisms that still must be elucidated. In this study, we have used a combination of transcriptomics and proteomics technologies to investigate the response of human hepatoma {PLC/PRF/5} cells to prohibitin silencing to define in detail the biological function of hepatic Phb1 and to elucidate potential prohibitin-dependent mechanisms participating in the maintenance of the transformed phenotype. Abrogation of prohibitin reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in human hepatoma cells in a mechanism dependent on {NF} {kappaB} signaling. Moreover, down-regulation of {ERp29} together with down-regulation of Erlin 2 suggests {ER} stress. In agreement, increased {C/EBP} homologous protein levels, poly-{ADP} ribose polymerase cleavage and activation of caspase 12 and downstream caspase 7 evidenced {ER} stress-induced apoptosis. Down-regulation of proteasome activator complex subunit 2 and stathmin as well as accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins suggest interplay between {ER} stress and proteasome malfunction. Taken together, our results provide evidences for prohibitin having a central role in the maintenance of the transformed and invasive phenotype of human hepatoma cells and may further support previous studies suggesting prohibitin as a potential clinical target.},

Worms expressing neuronal {SID-1} showed {RNAi} phenotypes when fed with bacteria expressing {dsRNA} for known neuronal genes and for uncharacterized genes with no previously known neuronal phenotypes. Neuronal expression of sid-1 decreased nonneuronal {RNAi}, suggesting that neurons expressing transgenic sid-1(+) served as a sink for {dsRNA.} This effect, or a sid-1(-) background, can be used to uncover neuronal defects for lethal genes. Expression of sid-1(+) from cell-specific promoters in sid-1 mutants results in cell-specific feeding {RNAi.} We used these strains to identify a role for integrin signaling genes in mechanosensation.},

	abstract = {Bite forces ({BFs)} based on a dry skull static model were computed for 122 specimens of all eight species of extant ursids. It was found that the giant panda has high {BFs} for its body size, and large moment arms about the temporomandibular joint, both muscle inlever moment arms and outlever moment arms to the carnassial and canine. The insectivorous sloth bear and to some extent the omnivorous black bears were the opposite. The small sun bear has very large canines and high {BFs}, which are not well understood, but could potentially be related to its frequent opening of tropical hardwood trees in pursuit of insects. Force profiles along the lower jaw revealed significant differences among the various species, both related to diet and inferred applied {BFs.} The panda is the only specialized ursid with respect to craniodental morphology and {BFs}, but is still unspecialized for herbivory compared with other large, herbivorous mammals, probably owing to a rather short evolutionary history, but possibly its morphology is constrained by genealogy. The low {BFs} in the sloth bear and its mandibular force profiles are derived for a diet of insects and fruit, requiring only low {BFs} and largely dorsoventral bite moments. In contrast, the unspecialized morphology and moderate {BFs} relative to body size of the polar bear and spectacled bear are probably also a result of a short evolutionary history.},

To search for additional cellular factors involved in membrane protein quality control, we isolated multicopy suppressors that alleviated the growth defect of the {ftsH/htpX} dual disruption mutant. One of them was {ybbK}, which is renamed {qmcA}, encoding a membrane-bound prohibitin homology ({PHB)} domain family protein. Multicopy suppression was also observed with {hflK-hflC}, encoding another set of {PHB} domain membrane proteins, which had been known to form a complex ({HflKC)} and to interact with {FtsH.} Whereas the {DeltaftsH} {sfhC21} (a viability defect suppressor for {DeltaftsH)} strain exhibited temperature sensitivity in the presence of {cAMP}, additional disruption of both {qmcA} and {hflK-hflC} exaggerated the growth defect. Pull-down and sedimentation experiments showed that {QmcA}, like {HflKC}, forms an oligomer and interacts with {FtsH.} Protease accessibility assays revealed that {QmcA}, unlike periplasmically exposed {HflKC}, possesses a cytoplasmically disposed large C-terminal domain, thus assuming the type I ({NOUT-CIN)} orientation.

The ability of the variants to stimulate microsomal conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholesterol (sterol carrier activity) and to transfer cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine from donor small unilamellar vesicles to acceptor membranes (cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine transfer activities) was compared with wild-type recombinant {SCP2.} Our results indicate that all measured activities of recombinant human pre-{SCP2} (including the 20-amino acid leader sequence) and mature {SCP2} were similar. Expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins ({GST-SCP2} and {GST-pre-SCP2)} possessed considerable activity, suggesting that steric obstruction at the amino terminus causes only minor inactivation. The effect of progressive removal of peptides from the carboxyl terminus showed that amino acids between Lys100 and Asn104 are essential for {SCP2} activity. This conclusion was substantiated by the observation that replacing Asn104 with Asp or Ile caused considerable inactivation, whereas replacing Met105 with Leu had almost no effect. Since N-ethylmaleimide is known to inhibit {SCP2} activity, substitutions were also introduced in the vicinity of Cys71. Whereas Val71 and Ser71 variants possessed wild-type activity, replacing Asp70 with Asn almost completely abolished {SCP2} activity. Further, the importance of residues located close to the amino terminus was indicated by complete inactivation of a 10-amino-terminal amino acid deletion mutant and by replacing Leu20 with Glu. Circular dichroism results showed that Leu20 and Asp70 may serve to stabilize the overall fold, whereas residue 104 appears to play a role in the specific lipid binding and/or transfer activity of {SCP2.}},

	abstract = {In Caenorhabditis elegans, introduction of double-stranded {RNA} ({dsRNA)} results in the specific inactivation of an endogenous gene with corresponding sequence; this technique is known as {RNA} interference ({RNAi).} It has previously been shown that {RNAi} can be performed by direct microinjection of {dsRNA} into adult hermaphrodite worms, by soaking worms in a solution of {dsRNA}, or by feeding worms Escherichia coli expressing target-gene {dsRNA.} We have developed a simple optimized protocol exploiting this third mode of {dsRNA} introduction, {RNAi} by feeding, which allows rapid and effective analysis of gene function in C. elegans. Furthermore, we have constructed a library of bacterial strains corresponding to roughly 86\% of the estimated 19,000 predicted genes in C. elegans, and we have used it to perform genome-wide analyses of gene function. This library is publicly available, reusable resource allowing for rapid large-scale {RNAi} experiments. We have used this library to perform genome-wide analyses of gene function in C. elegans. Here, we describe the protocols used for bacterial library construction and for high-throughput screening in C. elegans using {RNAi} by feeding.},

	abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance ({NMR)} spectroscopy was used to determine the secondary structure and the three-dimensional polypeptide backbone fold of the human sterol carrier protein 2 ({hSCP2)}, which is a basic protein with 123 residues believed to participate in the intracellular transport of cholesterol and various other lipids. Sequence-specific assignments were obtained for nearly all backbone {1H} and {15N} resonances, as well as for about two-thirds of the side-chain {1H} resonances, using uniform {15N-labeling} of the protein combined with homonuclear two-dimensional {1H} {NMR} and three-dimensional {15N-correlated} {1H} {NMR.} Three alpha-helices comprising the polypeptide segments of residues 9-22, 25-30 and 78-84 were identified by sequential and medium-range nuclear Overhauser effects ({NOE).} The analysis of long-range backbone-backbone {NOEs} showed that {hSCP2} further contains a five-stranded beta-sheet including the residues 33-41, 47-54, 60-62, 71-76 and 100-102, which is a central feature of the molecular architecture. The first three strands are arranged in an antiparallel fashion, the polypeptide chain then crosses over this three-stranded sheet in a right-handed sense so that the fourth strand is added parallel to the first one. The fifth strand runs antiparallel to the fourth one, so that the overall topology is +1, +1, -3x, -1. The three-dimensional arrangement of the beta-sheet and the first two helices was determined using an input of 625 {NOE} upper distance constraints and 95 scalar coupling constants for a preliminary structure calculation with the distance geometry program {DIANA.}},

We have purified this protein from normal {RBC} membranes and isolated a {cDNA} clone coding for it. The deduced protein sequence is unrelated to that of any known ion-transport-related protein. Selective solubilization studies using detergents show that while the protein is strongly associated with the phospholipid bilayer, it also binds to the cytoskeleton. The predicted polypeptide has a single trans-membranous hydrophobic segment near the N-terminus, which would locate it in the membrane; the large C-terminal domain is hydrophilic and cytoplasmic in orientation and is presumed to be responsible for the attachment to the cytoskeleton. By inference, the protein has the function of closing a latent ion channel. The messenger {RNA} encoding this protein is ubiquitously distributed in different human cell types and tissues and is thus presumably a widely distributed regulator of transmembrane cation fluxes. As a membrane-bound inhibitor protein of Na+ and K+ transport, it is unique among the known components of membrane-transport proteins.},

Academic libraries are beginning to examine what the expansion of data-intensive e-science means to scholarly communication and information services, and some are reshaping their own programmes to support the digital curation needs of research staff. These changes in libraries may involve repurposing or leveraging existing services, and the development or acquisition of new skills, roles, and organisational structures [1].

Scientific research data management is a fluid and evolving endeavour, reflective of the high rate of change in the information technology landscape, increasing levels of multi-disciplinary research, complex data structures and linkages, advances in data visualisation and analysis, and new tools capable of generating or capturing massive amounts of data.

These factors can create a complex and challenging environment for managing data, and one in which libraries can have a significant positive role supporting e-science. A needs assessment can help to characterise scientists' research methods and data management practices, highlighting gaps and barriers [2], and thereby improve the odds for libraries to plan appropriately and effectively implement services in the local setting [3].},

	abstract = {The genetic control of neuronal differentiation has been studied by examining mutations that affect the development and function of the six touch receptor neurons of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. By screening for touch-insensitive mutants, it has been possible to identify 18 genes (represented by 417 mutations) that are required at various stages in the developmental program for touch cell differentiation. Two of the genes are needed for the generation of precursors in the touch cell lineages; without the precursors, touch cells are not made. A third gene, mec-3, specifies the differentiation of the touch cells, probably by acting as a transcription factor. The remaining 15 genes are likely targets of mec-3 action; mutants defective in these genes have nonfunctioning, yet differentiated, touch cells. Some of these latter genes are needed for the formation of cell-specific components of the touch cells, such as a set of microtubules that are only found in these cells. The study of the touch genes should help us understand how touch cell fate is determined, how microtubule form is specified, and, perhaps, how mechanical stimuli are transduced.},

Social network theory and graph theory were used to analyse this network., Main outcome measures Citation bias, amplification, and invention, and their effects on determining authority., Results The network contained 242 papers and 675 citations addressing the belief, with 220 553 citation paths supporting it. Unfounded authority was established by citation bias against papers that refuted or weakened the belief; amplification, the marked expansion of the belief system by papers presenting no data addressing it; and forms of invention such as the conversion of hypothesis into fact through citation alone. Extension of this network into text within grants funded by the National Institutes of Health and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed the same phenomena present and sometimes used to justify requests for funding., Conclusion Citation is both an impartial scholarly method and a powerful form of social communication. Through distortions in its social use that include bias, amplification, and invention, citation can be used to generate information cascades resulting in unfounded authority of claims. Construction and analysis of a claim specific citation network may clarify the nature of a published belief system and expose distorted methods of social citation.},

	abstract = {In growing numbers, scholars are integrating social media tools like blogs, Twitter, and Mendeley into their professional communications. The online, public nature of these tools exposes and reifies scholarly processes once hidden and ephemeral. Metrics based on this activities could inform broader, faster measures of impact, complementing traditional citation metrics. This study explores the properties of these social media-based metrics or "altmetrics", sampling 24,331 articles published by the Public Library of Science. We find that that different indicators vary greatly in activity. Around 5\% of sampled articles are cited in Wikipedia, while close to 80\% have been included in at least one Mendeley library. There is, however, an encouraging diversity; a quarter of articles have nonzero data from five or more different sources. Correlation and factor analysis suggest citation and altmetrics indicators track related but distinct impacts, with neither able to describe the complete picture of scholarly use alone. There are moderate correlations between Mendeley and Web of Science citation, but many altmetric indicators seem to measure impact mostly orthogonal to citation. Articles cluster in ways that suggest five different impact "flavors", capturing impacts of different types on different audiences; for instance, some articles may be heavily read and saved by scholars but seldom cited. Together, these findings encourage more research into altmetrics as complements to traditional citation measures.},

	abstract = {Dispersal in slender-tailed meerkats or suricates, Suricata suricatta, in the south-western Kalahari occurred mainly during the early breeding season, and was age- and sex-dependent. Among yearlings, more males than females were immigrants, but more females than males disappeared. There were no sex differences in dispersal among two-year-olds, but among animals aged three years or older, more males than females emigrated. Most dispersers moved into adjacent bands or joined other transients, and females apparently suffered higher rates of mortality than males. Kinship with the same-sex or opposite-sex breeder had no discernible effect on the likelihood of dispersing. Both males and females made prospecting forays to other groups, apparently to assess dispersal and breeding opportunities. Males made frequent and repeated forays, often in coalitions with other band members or transients, whereas prospecting by females was generally solitary, and they were not known to make multiple forays. Prospecting males successfully took over dominance of two bands, and attempted to take over bands on three other occasions. Animals attempting to join or follow a band (trailers) behaved submissively and were readily chased by residents, whereas those attempting a dominance takeover (invaders) scent-marked at a high rate and showed no submissive behaviours. Dispersing meerkats maximized reproductive success by increasing their mating opportunities, while animals which delayed dispersal received indirect benefits by helping to raise kin.},

A critical component of this community is the common language of and the universal standards for scholarly citation, credit attribution, and the location and retrieval of articles and books. We propose a similar universal standard for citing quantitative data that retains the advantages of print citations, adds other components made possible by, and needed due to, the digital form and systematic nature of quantitative data sets, and is consistent with most existing subfield-specific approaches. Although the digital library field includes numerous creative ideas, we limit ourselves to only those elements that appear ready for easy practical use by scientists, journal editors, publishers, librarians, and archivists.},

Claiming that data sets are often only briefly described in the text, if at all, the authors believe data sets should receive the same level of citation as articles. To accomplish this, the authors suggest each citation should have a minimum of six parts: author, title, date, a unique global identifier, a universal numeric fingerprint, and a bridge service. The authors argue that these items are required for unambiguous identification of a data set or a subset of a data set.
The article is a well-written how-to guide on creating a data citation, giving examples throughout the text. Many of the authors’ suggestions are used in some of the data citation initiatives underway, such as the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center Data Product Citation Policy (http://daac.ornl.gov/citation\_policy.html). However, I am unaware of any data citation formats that include the universal numeric fingerprint. This type of information seems superfluous within the citation. Perhaps it would be more appropriate for this information to be situated on the landing page where the unique global identifier resolves.

We used in this report the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system to identify and characterize the genes that are affected by ethanol exposure and to link those genes functionally into an ethanol-induced gene network. By analyzing the expression profiles of all C. elegans {ORFs} using microarrays, we identified 230 genes affected by ethanol. While the ethanol response of some of the identified genes was significant at early time points, that of the majority was at late time points, indicating that the genes in the latter case might represent the physiological consequence of the ethanol exposure. We further characterized the early response genes that may represent those involved directly in the ethanol response. These genes included many heat shock protein genes, indicating that high concentration of ethanol acts as a strong stress to the animal. Interestingly, we identified two non-heat-shock protein genes that were specifically responsive to ethanol. glr-2 was the only glutamate receptor gene to be induced by ethanol. {T28C12.4}, which encodes a protein with limited homology to human neuroligin, was also specific to ethanol stress. Finally, by analyzing the promoter regions of the early response genes, we identified a regulatory element, {TCTGCGTCTCT}, that was necessary for the expression of subsets of ethanol response genes.},

The authors explain the structure of the data paper and provide an extensive list of metadata from which the data paper is built. They also describe a service called the Integrated Publishing Toolkit ({IPT)} from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility ({GBIF).} This tool provides a way for scientists to input metadata into a standardized format, then output the metadata into a data paper automatically. Use of this tool will help alleviate some of the effort required to create a data paper and encourage scientists to create them.
The data paper consists of the following parts: 1. bibliographic information such as author, date, title, and subject; 2. a citation to the data paper; 3. taxonomic, spatial, and temporal coverage information; and 4. descriptions of the data and collection methods. These parts are automatically generated from the metadata entered into the {IPT.}
The description of the data paper in this article closely resembles the data set guide documents I created for data sets at Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center. There, the guide docs contained all of the same information as Chavan’s and Penev’s proposed data papers, with the addition of some graphs and images to enhance the information. In my future career as a data curation librarian, I plan to implement a pilot study in which we explore seeding an institutional data repository with data sets from a specific research group on campus to develop methods and workflows. This paper will be a useful resource in preparing documentation for these data sets.

	abstract = {Although sterol carrier protein-2 ({SCP-2)} stimulates sterol transfer in vitro, almost nothing is known regarding the identity of the putative cholesterol binding site. Furthermore, the interrelationship(s) between this {SCP-2} ligand binding site and the recently reported {SCP-2} long chain fatty acid ({LCFA)} and long chain fatty acyl-{CoA} ({LCFA-CoA)} binding site(s) remains to be established. In the present work, two {SCP-2} ligand binding sites were identified. First, both [4-({13)C]cholesterol} and 22-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3beta-ol ({NBD-cholesterol)} binding assays were consistent with a single cholesterol binding site in {SCP-2.} This ligand binding site had high affinity for {NBD-cholesterol}, K(d) = 4.15 +/- 0.71 {nM.} ({13)C} {NMR-labeled} ligand competition studies demonstrated that the {SCP-2} high affinity cholesterol binding site also bound {LCFA} or {LCFA-CoA.} However, only the {LCFA-CoA} was able to effectively displace the {SCP-2-bound} [4-({13)C]cholesterol.} Thus, the ligand affinities at this {SCP-2} binding site were in the relative order cholesterol = {LCFA-CoA} {\textgreater} {LCFA.} Second, ({13)C} {NMR} studies demonstrated the presence of another ligand binding site on {SCP-2} that bound either {LCFA} or {LCFA-CoA} but not cholesterol. Photon correlation spectroscopy was consistent with {SCP-2} being monomeric in both liganded and unliganded states. In summary, both ({13)C} {NMR} and fluorescence techniques demonstrated for the first time that {SCP-2} had a single high affinity binding site that bound cholesterol, {LCFA}, or {LCFA-CoA.} Furthermore, results with ({13)C} {NMR} supported the presence of a second {SCP-2} ligand binding site that bound either {LCFA} or {LCFA-CoA} but not cholesterol. These data contribute to our understanding of a role for {SCP-2} in both cellular cholesterol and {LCFA} metabolism.},

Among the over 2000 papers in our original data set, we examine the fifty that, by the measures of our previous study, were predicted to do best and we find that they have indeed received substantially more citations in the intervening years than other papers, even after controlling for the number of prior citations. On average these top fifty papers have received 23 times as many citations in the last five years as the average paper in the data set as a whole, and 15 times as many as the average paper in a randomly drawn control group that started out with the same number of citations. Applying our prediction technique to current data, we also make new predictions of papers that we believe will be well cited in the next few years.},

Much of the knowledge base and intellectual assets of institutions and individuals are now in digital form. The term digital curation is increasingly being used for the actions needed to add value to and maintain these digital assets over time for current and future generations of users. The paper explores this emerging field of digital curation as an area of inter-disciplinary research and practice, and the trends which are influencing its development. It analyses the genesis of the term and how traditional roles relating to digital assets are in transition. Finally it explores some of the drivers for curation ranging from trends such as exponential growth in digital information, to "life-caching", digital preservation, the Grid and new opportunities for publishing, sharing, and re-using data. It concludes that significant effort needs to be put into developing a persistent information infrastructure for digital materials and into developing the digital curation skills of researchers and information professionals. Without this, current investment in digitisation and digital content will only secure short-term rather than lasting benefits.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial morphology is determined by a dynamic equilibrium between organelle fusion and fission, but the significance of these processes in vertebrates is unknown. The mitofusins, Mfn1 and Mfn2, have been shown to affect mitochondrial morphology when overexpressed. We find that mice deficient in either Mfn1 or Mfn2 die in midgestation. However, whereas Mfn2 mutant embryos have a specific and severe disruption of the placental trophoblast giant cell layer, Mfn1-deficient giant cells are normal. Embryonic fibroblasts lacking Mfn1 or Mfn2 display distinct types of fragmented mitochondria, a phenotype we determine to be due to a severe reduction in mitochondrial fusion. Moreover, we find that Mfn1 and Mfn2 form homotypic and heterotypic complexes and show, by rescue of mutant cells, that the homotypic complexes are functional for fusion. We conclude that Mfn1 and Mfn2 have both redundant and distinct functions and act in three separate molecular complexes to promote mitochondrial fusion. Strikingly, a subset of mitochondria in mutant cells lose membrane potential. Therefore, mitochondrial fusion is essential for embryonic development, and by enabling cooperation between mitochondria, has protective effects on the mitochondrial population.},

	abstract = {Glycosphingolipids ({GSLs)} and glycoproteins are ubiquitous components of mammalian cell membranes. {GSLs} are especially enriched in the nervous system and significantly contribute to membrane organization and a variety of cellular functions. Current body of evidence suggests that {GSLs} along with cholesterol are enriched in discrete membrane domains that associate specific proteins. Current notion of membrane organization is that, the {GSL-cholesterol-enriched} membrane domains known as 'lipid rafts' float in the phospholipid-enriched bulk of the membrane and regulate the cell signaling by facilitating the lipid-protein/protein-protein interactions. The sizeable literature accumulated during the last decade has provided some insight into the organization and function of rafts; however, they still remain perplexing. In recent years, an appealing concept of lipid raft heterogeneity has emerged. {GSL-} and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins are considered as the crucial pivots of heterogeneous rafts. This review deals with the enigma of organizational and functional heterogeneity of lipid rafts and discusses the dynamic coalescence of heterogeneous rafts during signaling that can explain the specificity of raft-regulated cellular signaling events.},

	abstract = {The sterol carrier protein-2 like 3 gene ({AeSCP-2L3)}, a new member of the {SCP-2} protein family, is identified from the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. The predicted molecular weight of {AeSCP-2L3} is 13.4 {kDa} with a calculated {pI} of 4.98. {AeSCP-2L3} transcription occurs in the larval feeding stages and the {mRNA} levels decrease in pupae and adults. The highest levels of {AeSCP-2L3} gene expression are found in the body wall, and possibly originated in the fat body. This is the first report of a mosquito {SCP-2-like} protein with prominent expression in tissue other than the midgut. The X-ray protein crystal structure of {AeSCP-2L3} reveals a bound C16 fatty acid whose acyl tail penetrates deeply into a hydrophobic cavity. Interestingly, the ligand-binding cavity is slightly larger than previously described for {AeSCP-2} (Dyer et al. J Biol Chem 278:39085-39091, 2003) and {AeSCP-2L2} (Dyer et al. J Lipid Res M700460-{JLR200}, 2007). There are also an additional 10 amino acids in {SCP-2L3} that are not present in other characterized mosquito {SCP-2s} forming an extended loop between beta 3 and beta 4. Otherwise, the protein backbone is exceedingly similar to other {SCP-2} and {SCP-2-like} proteins. In contrast to this observed high structural homology of members in the mosquito {SCP2} family, the amino acid sequence identity between the members is less than 30\%. The results from structural analysis imply that there have been evolutionary constraints that favor the {SCP-2} C(alpha) backbone fold while the specificity of ligand binding can be altered.},

	abstract = {Embryonal brain tumors are a heterogeneous group of neoplasms united by the presence of poorly differentiated stem-like cells. Molecular details are increasingly being used to separate them into biologically and clinically meaningful groups. For medulloblastoma, integrated {mRNA} expression profiling and {DNA} analysis by a number of research groups defines 4–6 distinctive molecular variants. A subset with prominent Wnt activity is associated with good clinical outcomes and classic histology. Medulloblastomas showing a Hedgehog gene expression signature are frequently of the desmoplastic/nodular subtype. Interestingly, Hedgehog activity is found in tumors arising either in infants or older teenagers and adults. The association of clinically aggressive medulloblastoma with {MYC} expression, large cell/anaplastic change and high levels of photoreceptor differentiation transcripts has also been noted in several studies. Immunohistochemical analysis of just one or two genes per molecular medulloblastoma variant may be sufficient for accurate classification, and this would be of great practical utility if validated. Advances have also been made in the classification of central nervous system ({CNS)} Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors ({PNET)}, as several groups have identified an amplicon at chromosome 19q13.41–42, which appears to define a unique {PNET} subtype associated with prominent true rosettes, young age and very poor outcomes.},

Recently we have shown that {PHB} undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to insulin and here we report that {PHB} interacts with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate ({PIP3).} Furthermore, we demonstrate that over expression of {PHB} attenuates insulin signaling downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3 ({PI3)} kinase. This effect was not observed with over expression of tyrosine phosphorylation site mutant-{PHB} suggesting a role for tyrosine phosphorylation of {PHB} in this process. Interestingly phosphorylation of {PHB} by Akt attenuates its interaction with {PIP3} and enhances insulin signaling. Thus, phosphorylation of {PHB} and its interaction with {PIP3} may be a part of the regulatory mechanisms that is involved in the modulation of insulin signaling. We speculate that phosphorylation of {PHB} may serve as a general mechanism in the regulation of {PI3} kinase signaling including growth factors and immune receptor signaling.},

	abstract = {To identify hypothesized missing components of the synaptic Gαo-Gαq signaling network, which tightly regulates neurotransmitter release, we undertook two large forward genetic screens in the model organism C. elegans and focused first on mutations that strongly rescue the paralysis of ric-8(md303) reduction-of-function mutants, previously shown to be defective in Gαq pathway activation. Through high-resolution mapping followed by sequence analysis, we show that these mutations affect four genes. Two activate the Gαq pathway through gain-of-function mutations in Gαq; however, all of the remaining mutations activate components of the Gαs pathway, including Gαs, adenylyl cyclase, and protein kinase A. Pharmacological assays suggest that the Gαs pathway-activating mutations increase steady-state neurotransmitter release, and the strongly impaired neurotransmitter release of ric-8(md303) mutants is rescued to greater than wild-type levels by the strongest Gαs pathway activating mutations. Using transgene induction studies, we show that activating the Gαs pathway in adult animals rapidly induces hyperactive locomotion and rapidly rescues the paralysis of the ric-8 mutant. Using cell-specific promoters we show that neuronal, but not muscle, Gαs pathway activation is sufficient to rescue ric-8(md303)'s paralysis. Our results appear to link {RIC-8} (synembryn) and a third major Gα pathway, the Gαs pathway, with the previously discovered Gαo and Gαq pathways of the synaptic signaling network.},

Initial investigations focused on the role of Phb1 as an inhibitor of cell proliferation hence the original name prohibitin. However both proteins appear to have a diverse range of functions and recent evidence suggests that the prohibitins have very similar but as yet only partially understood functions. In addition to their role as chaperone proteins in the mitochondria, and their ability to target to lipid rafts, their is now compelling evidence that both prohibitins are localized in the nucleus and can modulate transcriptional activity by interacting with various transcription factors, including the steroid hormone receptors, either directly or indirectly. In addition Phb1 and Phb2 are present in the circulation and can be internalized when added to cultured cells suggesting that the circulating prohibitins may have some regulatory role. This review presents some of the recent developments in prohibitin research and focuses on the similarities in the structure and function of these interesting proteins.},

	abstract = {Nephronophthisis ({NPHP)}, an autosomal-recessive cystic kidney disease, is the most frequent genetic cause of end-stage renal failure in children. {NPHP} types 1 and 4 are caused by mutations in {NPHP1} and {NPHP4}, encoding the proteins nephrocystin-1 and nephrocystin-4, respectively. Nephrocystin-1 and nephrocystin-4 are expressed in primary cilia of renal epithelial cells. {NPHP1} and {NPHP4} are highly conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans. However, this species does not have a kidney but an excretory system that consists of an excretory cell, an excretory gland cell, a duct cell, and a pore cell. Therefore, cell type-specific expression pattern and function of the nephrocystin homologs in C. elegans were of interest. Expression of green fluorescence protein fusion constructs that contain the C. elegans promoter regions for nph-1 and nph-4 was not found in the excretory system but in ciliated sensory neurons of the head (amphid neurons) and the tail in hermaphrodites (phasmid neurons) and males (sensory ray neurons). As the knockout phenotype for the {PKD} homologs lov-1 and pkd-2 shows impaired male mating behavior, {RNAi} knockdown animals were analyzed for this phenotype. A similar phenotype was found in the nph-1 and nph-4 {RNAi} knockdown animals compared with the lov-1 and pkd-2 knockout phenotype. Thus, it is suggested that renal cyst-causing genes may be part of a shared functional module, highly conserved in evolution. The {NPHP} homologs may be necessary for initial assembly of the cilium, whereas the polycystic kidney disease homologs may function as sensory transducers.},

	abstract = {Ca(2+) is a major signaling molecule in both excitable and non-excitable cells, where it serves critical functions ranging from cell growth to differentiation to cell death. The physiological functions of these cells are tightly regulated in response to changes in cytosolic Ca(2+) that is achieved by the activation of several plasma membrane ({PM)} Ca(2+) channels as well as release of Ca(2+) from the internal stores. One such channel is referred to as store-operated Ca(2+) channel that is activated by the release of endoplasmic reticulum ({ER)} Ca(2+) which initiates store-operated Ca(2+) entry ({SOCE).} Recent advances in the field suggest that some members of {TRPCs} and Orai channels function as {SOCE} channels. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate channel activity and the exact nature of where these channels are assembled and regulated remain elusive. Research from several laboratories has demonstrated that key proteins involved in Ca(2+) signaling are localized in discrete {PM} lipid rafts/caveolar microdomains. Lipid rafts are cholesterol and sphingolipid-enriched microdomains that function as unique signal transduction platforms. In addition lipid rafts are dynamic in nature which tends to scaffold certain signaling molecules while excluding others. By such spatial segregation, lipid rafts not only provide a favorable environment for intra-molecular cross-talk but also aid to expedite the signal relay. Importantly, Ca(2+) signaling is shown to initiate from these lipid raft microdomains. Clustering of Ca(2+) channels and their regulators in such microdomains can provide an exquisite spatiotemporal regulation of Ca(2+)-mediated cellular function. Thus in this review we discuss {PM} lipid rafts and caveolae as Ca(2+)-signaling microdomains and highlight their importance in organizing and regulating {SOCE} channels.},

	abstract = {We showed previously that {GLUT-1} glucose transporter is associated with stomatin (band 7.2b) in human red blood cell membranes and in Clone 9 cells. We show here that in a mixed population of stably transfected cells, overexpression of either murine or human stomatin resulted in 35-50\% reduction in the basal rate of glucose transport. Moreover, there was a correlation between increased expression of stomatin and depression in the rate of glucose transport. In two clones chosen for further study, the {\textasciitilde}10\% and {\textasciitilde}70\% reduction in basal rate of glucose transport was associated with increases in stomatin {mRNA} and protein expression without a detectable change in {GLUT-1} content in plasma membranes of either clone. In the clone overexpressing high levels of stomatin, immunoprecipitated {GLUT-1} was associated with a large amount of stomatin as a coimmunoprecipitant. Employing extracts of cells overexpressing human stomatin, we found that stomatin bound to the glutathione-S-transferase ({GST)} fusion protein containing the {COOH-terminal} 42-amino acid segment of {GLUT-1} but not to {GST} alone or a {GST} fusion protein containing the 66-amino acid central loop of {GLUT-1.} Rat stomatin {cDNA} was cloned by {RT-PCR} and found to be highly homologous to mouse (97\%) and human (86\%) stomatins. These results suggest that overexpression of stomatin results in a depression in the basal rate of glucose transport by decreasing the "intrinsic" activity of {GLUT-1}, probably through protein-protein interaction.},

Reproduction of C. elegans in defined medium was enhanced by formulation in agar. Propagation of C. elegans in either agar-based or aqueous defined medium supplemented with [({1)C]cholesterol} of high specific activity failed to result in production of radiolabeled free ecdysteroids or polar or apolar ecdysteroid conjugates.

In the 544 km2 Royal Chitawan National Park in the Nepal terai, we estimated there were a minimum of 55 bears or a crude density of 0˙1/km2. During peak concentrations in the lowlying riverine forest/tall grass habitat in March, the ecological density was {0˙5/km2.Cubs} still with their mothers comprised 24 \% of the 161 bears classified between December 1972 and November 1975. Females comprised 48\% of the adults classified. Average size of 24 litters was 1˙6 (1–2). Seventy-two per cent of the observations were of lone individuals. Three (an adult female with two cubs), was the largest group of bears seen. The only extended social group observed was the female-young unit although newly independent siblings may remain together for a short time. Maternal relations, adult interactions, tree marking, ranging, feeding and anti-predatory behaviour are {described.Examination} of 139 droppings showed that these bears fed on at least 17 different fruits (47\% occurrence), flowers, grass, honey, and six different insects (52\% occurrence). Fruits were an important food from March to June with individual species predominating throughout their fruiting season. Termites, including Odontotermes obesus, were in the diet for most of the year. The Sloth bear was not observed preying on mammals and according to other observers, only rarely feeds on carrion.

At early tail bud stages, there is additional expression in the paraxial mesoderm. At late tail bud stages, {flotillin1A} is expressed in branchial arch mesenchyme, the overlying branchial ectoderm and in dorsal somitic mesoderm, whereas {flotillin1B} expression is more restricted in the dorsal neural tube and head sensory structures.

The study results show that some researchers are motivated to share through altruism, hope for collaboration, or peer pressure. Unfortunately, however, the incentive to share data faces headwinds because of lack of recognition or reward for publishing data sets. Regarding peer review of data sets, the study found that while the researchers who created the data sets are best suited to ensuring the quality of those data, no clear standards for reviewing quality of data sets exists.
In this annotation, I focus on the motivations and incentives for researchers to share their data sets. The results of this study show that researchers are generally not as concerned with publishing and sharing their data sets when the pressure to publish articles is so high. Researchers are engaged in a cycle of pressure to get funding, pressure to publish from that funding, and then pressure to get more funding. Swan and Brown found that researchers would be willing to share their data sets if three questions were answered. The first concerns the benefits of sharing data, the second, a workable data citation mechanism, and the third, clear career rewards for sharing data.

	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to examine the extent to which social science research data are shared and assess whether data sharing affects research productivity tied to the research data themselves. We construct a database from administrative records containing information about thousands of social science studies that have been conducted over the last 40 years. Included in the database are descriptions of social science data collections funded by the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. A survey of the principal investigators of a subset of these social science awards was also conducted. We report that very few social science data collections are preserved and disseminated by an archive or institutional repository. Informal sharing of data in the social sciences is much more common. The main analysis examines publication metrics that can be tied to the research data collected with {NSF} and {NIH} funding – total publications, primary publications (including {PI)}, and secondary publications (non-research team). Multivariate models of count of publications suggest that data sharing, especially sharing data through an archive, leads to many more times the publications than not sharing data. This finding is robust even when the models are adjusted for {PI} characteristics, grant award features, and institutional characteristics.},

In the nematode C. elegans, these cues are sensed by a small number of olfactory neurons, each of which expresses several different odorant receptors. The type of behavioral response elicited by an odorant could be specified by the olfactory receptor or by the olfactory neuron in which the receptor is activated. The attractive odorant diacetyl is detected by the receptor protein {ODR-10}, which is normally expressed in the {AWA} olfactory neurons. The repulsive odorant 2-nonanone is detected by the {AWB} olfactory neurons. Transgenic animals that express {ODR-10} in {AWB} rather than {AWA} avoid diacetyl, while maintaining qualitatively normal responses to other attractive and repulsive odorants. Animals that express {ODR-10} simultaneously in {AWA} and {AWB} have a defective response to diacetyl, possibly because of conflicting olfactory inputs. Thus, an animal's preference for an odor is defined by the sensory neurons that express a given odorant receptor molecule.},

To better understand the important variables that affect locomotion, we have described in detail the locomotory behavior of C. elegans and identified a set of parameters that are sufficient to describe the animal's trajectory. A model of locomotion based on these parameters indicates that reversal frequency plays a central role in locomotion. We found that several variables such as humidity, gravidity, and mechanostimulation influence reversal frequency. Specifically, both gentle and harsh touch can transiently suppress reversal frequency. Thus, reversal behavior is a model for the integration of information from numerous modalities reflecting diverse aspects of the state of an organism.},

The identification of an odorant-sensitive adenylate cyclase which responds to most odorants, affords a second messenger system following odorant interactions with receptors. Cyclic nucleotide- and odorant-gated ion channels have been demonstrated in olfactory cilia, providing signalling systems in place of or in addition to protein phosphorylation. A unique odorant-binding protein localized to nasal mucosa binds odorants in proportion to their odoriferous potencies. Molecular cloning of the isolated protein reveals it to be a member of a family of proteins that serve as carriers for small lipophilic molecules such as retinol and cholesterol. The odorant-binding protein is localized to lateral nasal glands whose secretions are atomized into the tip of the nose where the binding protein presumably interacts with odorants in the inspired air.},

	abstract = {In recent years, a number of data identification technologies have been developed which purport to permanently identify digital objects. In this paper, nine technologies and systems for assigning persistent identifiers are assessed for their applicability to Earth science data ({ARKs}, {DOIs}, {XRIs}, Handles, {LSIDs}, {OIDs}, {PURLs}, {URIs/URNs/URLs}, and {UUIDs).} The evaluation used four use cases that focused on the suitability of each scheme to provide Unique Identifiers for Earth science data objects, to provide Unique Locators for the objects, to serve as Citable Locators, and to uniquely identify the scientific contents of data objects if the data were reformatted. Of all the identifier schemes assessed, the one that most closely meets all of the requirements for an Unique Identifier is the {UUID} scheme. Any of the {URL/URI/IRI-based} identifier schemes assessed could be used for Unique Locators. Since there are currently no strong market leaders to help make the choice among them, the decision must be based on secondary criteria. While most publications now allow the use of {URLs} in citations, so that all of the {URL/URI/IRI} based identification schemes discussed in this paper could potentially be used as a Citable Locator, {DOIs} are the identification scheme currently adopted by most commercial publishers. None of the identifier schemes assessed here even minimally address identification of scientifically identical numerical data sets under reformatting.},

	annote = {This article discusses and compares nine unique identifiers ({UID)} and evaluates them on how well they can identify and locate a data set. For each of the nine {UIDs}, the authors evaluate them on four use cases and compare each. First, they evaluate them on how well they function as unique identifiers, meaning how well the expression captures and uniquely identifies the data set. They also evaluate the {UIDs} on how well they can uniquely locate the data sets, meaning if someone knew the {UID} of a data set, they would be able to locate it and download it. Thirdly, they evaluate each {UID} on whether or not it is a citable identifier, which means the {UID} can be used within a citation. Last, they evaluate the {UIDs} on the basis of being able to identify a scientifically unique data set. This use case is distinct from the first use case (how well it uniquely identifies a data set). In the first use case, the unique identifier simply identifies one data set, but in the last use case, the unique identifier would be able to facilitate determination of whether or not two data sets were scientifically the same, even if they were different formats.
The results of the evaluation show that for the first use case (unique identifier) the Universally Unique Identifier served this need the best. For the second use case (unique locator), the authors found the Digital Object Identifier to be most suitable, as it is supported by {DataCite} (see Brase, 2009). Of the nine unique identifiers evaluated, the authors found that most of them work well for uniquely locating a data set (the third use case), but the Archival Resource Key (see Willett \& Kunze, 2013) provides more metadata embedded within it and the Handle System has the largest user base, which may be an indication of longevity. The authors found that none of the unique identifiers evaluated were suitable in the fourth use case (scientifically unique identifier).
While this study focused the evaluation of the nine unique identifiers on their suitability for earth science data, one could use the detailed and comprehensive evaluation for other types of data. Much of it may be suitable as-is for other types of data, while others may need to be evaluated again. In my future career, I expect that I will be advising not only faculty researchers on the use of unique identifiers for their data sets, but also guiding policy within the library on assigning unique identifiers to data sets ingested to the repository. This guide provides a thorough, unbiased explanation of the strengths and weaknesses of each type of identifier.

In yeast, levels of this complex are increased on co-overexpression of both Phb1p and Phb2p, suggesting that these two proteins are the only components of the complex. Pulse-chase experiments with mitochondria isolated from phb1/phb2-null and {PHB1/2} overexpressing cells show that the Phb1/2 complex is able to stabilize newly synthesized mitochondrial translation products. This stabilization probably occurs through a direct interaction because association of mitochondrial translation products with the Phb1/2 complex could be demonstrated. The fact that Phb1/2 is a large multimeric complex, which provides protection of native peptides against proteolysis, suggests a functional homology with protein chaperones with respect to their ability to hold and prevent misfolding of newly synthesized proteins.},

Although the products of other mec genes are key players in the biophysics of transduction, the mechanism by which they contribute to the properties of the channel is unknown. Here, we investigate the role of two auxiliary channel subunits, {MEC-2} (stomatin-like) and {MEC-6} (paraoxonase-like), by coexpressing them with constitutively active {MEC-4/MEC-10} heteromeric channels in Xenopus oocytes. This work extends prior work demonstrating that {MEC-2} and {MEC-6} synergistically increase macroscopic current. We use single-channel recordings and biochemistry to show that these auxiliary subunits alter function by increasing the number of channels in an active state rather than by dramatically affecting either single-channel properties or surface expression. We also use two-electrode voltage clamp and outside-out macropatch recording to examine the effects of divalent cations and proteases, known regulators of channel family members. Finally, we examine the role of cholesterol binding in the mechanism of {MEC-2} action by measuring whole-cell and single-channel currents in {MEC-2} mutants deficient in cholesterol binding. We suggest that {MEC-2} and {MEC-6} play essential roles in modulating both the local membrane environment of {MEC-4/MEC-10} channels and the availability of such channels to be gated by force in vivo.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Attempts to account for observed variation in the degree of reproductive skew among cooperative breeders have usually assumed that subordinate breeding has fitness costs to dominant females. They argue that dominant females concede reproductive opportunities to subordinates to retain them in the group or to dissuade them from challenging for the dominant position or that subordinate females breed where dominants are incapable of controlling them. However, an alternative possibility is that suppressing subordinate reproduction has substantive costs to the fitness of dominant females and that variation in these costs generates differences in the net benefits of suppression to dominants which are responsible for variation in the frequency of subordinate breeding that is not a consequence of either reproductive concessions or limitations in dominant control. Here, we show that, in wild Kalahari meerkats (Suricata suricatta), the frequency with which dominants evict subordinates or kill their pups varies with the costs and benefits to dominants of suppressing subordinate breeding, including the dominants' reproductive status, the size of their group, and the relatedness of subordinates. We review evidence from other studies that the suppression of reproduction by subordinates varies with the likely costs of subordinate breeding to dominants.},

However, there is a lack of studies in natural populations that provide reliable measures of reproductive skew and the correlates of reproductive success, particularly in vertebrates. We present results of a study that uses a combination of field and genetic (microsatellite) data on a cooperatively breeding mongoose, the meerkat (Suricata suricatta). We sampled 458 individuals from 16 groups at two sites and analyzed parentage of pups in 110 litters with up to 12 microsatellites. We show that there is strong reproductive skew in favor of dominants, but that the extent of skew differs between the sexes and between different sites. Our data suggest that the reproductive skew arises from incest avoidance and reproductive suppression of the subordinates by the dominants.},

	shorttitle = {Connectivity Conservation Management},
	abstract = {In an era of climate change, deforestation and massive habitat loss, we can no longer rely on parks and protected areas as isolated islands of wilderness to conserve and protect vital biodiversity. Increasing connections are being considered and made between protected areas, and connectivity thinking has started to expand to the regional and even the continental scale to match the challenges of conserving biodiversity in the face of global environmental change. This groundbreaking book is the first guide to conservation management at regional and continental scales. Written by leading conservation and protected area management specialists under the auspices of the World Commission on Protected Areas of {IUCN}, the World Conservation Union, this guide brings together a decade and a half of practice and covers all aspects of connectivity planning and management. The book begins by addressing the need for connectivity conservation as a strategic imperative in the face of climate change, explains what connectivity conservation is and explores the key management challenges and issues including policy change and formation and capacity building. Successive chapters cover technical aspects including the natural setting, landscape, habitat, ecological and evolutionary process connectivity and human-oriented factors including values and aspirations, life support, livelihoods and sustainable resource use. The authors then cover the full swathe of the management context and dynamic including national reserve settings, connectivity management tools and stewardship needs. Further chapters look at practice and case studies from around the world including in-depth examination of the Yellowstone to Yukon ({Y2Y)} project which spans much of the Continental Divide of North America and takes in dozens of protected areas and vast areas of private and public land across national, state and provincial boundaries. Further international examples are drawn form the Udvardy Biogeographical Realms of Africotropical, Australian, Indomalayan, Nearctic, Neotropical Oceanian and Palaearctic. Final chapters synthesize the lessons learned from the past decade and a half of theory and practice for management and the authors look at the key challenges of the future, particularly the threat of climate change and the variable capacity of countries and regions to respond. This handbook is a must have for all professionals in protected area management, conservation, land management and resource management from the field through senior management and policy. It is also an ideal reference for students and academics in geography, protected area management and form across the environmental and natural sciences.},

	abstract = {The prohibitin 3' untranslated region ({3'UTR)} belongs to a novel class of non-coding regulatory {RNAs.} It arrests cell cycle progression by blocking G1-S transition in breast and other cancers. Our previous studies comparing {MCF7} derived clones constitutively expressing a common allelic form of prohibitin {RNA} ({UTR/C)} to various controls demonstrated that it functions as a tumor suppressor. Here, we further characterized the morphology and motility of these transgenic breast cancer cells when grown in cell culture and on nude mice. In contrast to empty vector ({EV)} cells, {UTR/C} cells were observed to grow in an organized manner with more cell-cell contact and differentiate into structures with a duct-like appearance. Computer assisted cytometry to evaluate differences in nuclear morphology was performed on {UTR/C} and {EV} tissues from nude mice. Receiver operator curve areas generated using a logistic regression model were 0.8, indicating the ability to quantitatively distinguish {UTR/C} from {EV} tissues. Keratinocyte growth factor-induced motility experiments showed that migration of {UTR/C} cells was significantly reduced (80-90\%) compared to {EV} cells. Together, these data indicate that this novel {3'UTR} influences not only the tumorigenic phenotype but also may play a role in differentiation and migration of breast cancer cells.},

	abstract = {Meerkats live in co-operatively breeding familial groups in which reproduction is monopolised by a dominant pair of breeders. Offspring of the breeders are behaviourally subordinate, and typically remain in their natal group as sexually mature, non-breeding helpers. In this study, we investigated the proximate factors limiting subordinate reproduction. Evidence for reproductive suppression by dominants was investigated by comparing life history, behaviour and hormonal profiles of dominants and subordinates. Baseline levels of plasma luteinising hormone ({LH)} were significantly higher in dominant than in subordinate females. However, following an exogenous injection of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone ({GnRH)}, both categories had comparable concentrations of circulating {LH.} There were no significant differences in pre- or post-{GnRH} challenge {LH} levels in dominant or subordinate males. Reproduction in both dominant and subordinate females rarely occurred in the absence of unrelated males. Given that groups typically comprise parents and offspring, lack of suitable mates emerged as the primary constraint on subordinate reproduction. When this constraint was removed, subordinates typically bred but at a lower rate than dominants. This difference in reproduction may be attributed to intrasexual competition manifested through direct interference by dominant females through subordinate evictions, infanticide and the abandoning of subordinate litters. We argue that differences in reproductive regulation within mammalian co-operative breeding systems may be explained by differences in the mating strategy (inbreeding versus outbreeding) and the probability that subordinates in obligate outbreeding species will encounter unrelated opposite-sex partners.},

	abstract = {The majority of mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine ({PtdEtn)}, a phospholipid essential for aerobic growth of yeast cells, is synthesized by phosphatidylserine decarboxylase 1 (Psd1p) in the inner mitochondrial membrane ({IMM).} To identify components that become essential when the level of mitochondrial {PtdEtn} is decreased, we screened for mutants that are synthetically lethal with a temperature-sensitive (ts) allele of {PSD1.} This screen unveiled mutations in {PHB1} and {PHB2} encoding the two subunits of the prohibitin complex, which is located to the {IMM} and required for the stability of mitochondrially encoded proteins. Deletion of {PHB1} and {PHB2} resulted in an increase of mitochondrial {PtdEtn} at 30 degrees C. On glucose media, {phb1Delta} {psd1Delta} and {phb2Delta} {psd1Delta} double mutants were rescued only for a limited number of generations by exogenous ethanolamine, indicating that a decrease of the {PtdEtn} level is detrimental for prohibitin mutants. Similar to phb mutants, deletion of {PSD1} destabilizes polypeptides encoded by the mitochondrial genome. In a {phb1Delta} {phb2Delta} psd1(ts) strain the destabilizing effect is dramatically enhanced. In addition, the mitochondrial genome is lost in this triple mutant, and nuclear-encoded proteins of the {IMM} are assembled at a very low rate. At the nonpermissive temperature mitochondria of {phb1Delta} {phb2Delta} psd1(ts) were fragmented and aggregated. In conclusion, destabilizing effects triggered by low levels of mitochondrial {PtdEtn} seem to account for synthetic lethality of {psd1Delta} with phb mutants.},

Average group size varies from four to nine, and groups typically include several mature females, of which one is responsible for the majority of breeding attempts. Breeding females show a postpartum oestrus; gestation is around 60 days; litter size is three to five pups at emergence and females rarely breed before the age of 24 months. In contrast, annual survival rates (0.20 for pups and 0.43 for animals over one year old) are lower than those recorded in other species. Breeding frequency is related to rainfall and breeding can cease altogether when rainfall is unusually low. In a year when this occurred, group size eroded rapidly and over 60\% of groups became extinct. Total numbers were slow to recover during the following year because emigration by females was infrequent and new groups did not form in vacant ranges created by the extinction of groups. High rates of group extinction have been found in other cooperative breeders and may occur because breeding success and survival show inverse density dependence.},

	abstract = {Time is running out for the opportunity to study the New Guinea singing dog (\textit{Canis hallstromi }Troughton 1957) to determine if they are a unique taxon. These wild canids are being threatened with hybridization from increasing numbers of imported domestic dogs (\textit{Canis familiaris}). The controversies over their taxonomy and its status in New Guinea exist because they live in areas infrequently visited even by local residents. Thus, evidence concerning its origins, behaviour, anatomy, and phylogenetics is inadequate. The morphological, physiological, and {DNA} data we currently have available are from the few remaining captive representatives held in zoos and private facilities. The singing dog may be an important evolutionary link to humankind's most ancient domesticated mammal, \textit{C. familiaris}, and to the Australian dingo (\textit{Canis dingo}). We refute the allegation that the singing dog originated as a feral modern \textit{C. familiaris}, or as hybrids of\textit{ C. dingo} with \textit{C. familiaris}, by recounting their known history within the cultural context of New Guinea. We point out some of their distinctive characteristics, including their unique estrus cycles, and outline their potential scientific merit. We conclude by offering an alternative taxonomic hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Palmitate, a 16-carbon saturated fatty acid, is attached to more than 100 proteins. Modification of proteins by palmitate has pleiotropic effects on protein function. Palmitoylation can influence membrane binding and membrane targeting of the modified proteins. In particular, many palmitoylated proteins concentrate in lipid rafts, and enrichment in rafts is required for efficient signal transduction. This Review focuses on the multiple effects of palmitoylation on the localization and function of ligands, receptors, and intracellular signaling proteins. Palmitoylation regulates the trafficking and function of transmembrane proteins such as ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors, and integrins. In addition, immune receptor signaling relies on protein palmitoylation at many levels, including palmitoylated co-receptors, Src family kinases, and adaptor or scaffolding proteins. The localization and signaling capacities of Ras and G proteins are modulated by dynamic protein palmitoylation. Cycles of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation allow H-Ras and G protein alpha subunits to reversibly bind to and signal from different intracellular cell membranes. Moreover, secreted ligands such as Hedgehog, Wingless, and Spitz use palmitoylation to regulate the extent of long- or short-range signaling. Finally, palmitoylation can alter signaling protein function by direct effects on enzymatic activity and substrate specificity. The identification of the palmitoyl acyltransferases has provided new insights into the biochemistry of this posttranslational process and permitted new substrates to be identified.},

	abstract = {The reggie protein family consists of two proteins, reggie-1 and -2, also called flotillins, which are highly ubiquitous and evolutionarily conserved. Both reggies have been shown to be associated with membrane rafts and are involved in various cellular processes such as T-cell activation, phagocytosis and insulin signalling. However, the exact molecular function of these proteins remains to be determined. In addition, the mechanism of membrane association of reggie-1, which does not contain any transmembrane domain, is not known. In this study, we have produced a fusion protein of reggie-1 with enhanced green fluorescent protein and generated targeted substitutions for the inactivation of putative palmitoylation and myristoylation sites. We were able to show that reggie-1 is myristoylated and multiply palmitoylated and that lipid modifications are necessary for membrane association of reggie-1. Overexpression of reggie-1 resulted in the induction of numerous filopodia-like protrusions in various cell lines, suggesting a role for reggie-1 as a signalling protein in actin-dependent processes.},

We show here that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits a strong behavioural preference for 5-12\% oxygen, avoiding higher and lower oxygen levels. 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate ({cGMP)} is a common second messenger in sensory transduction and is implicated in oxygen sensation. Avoidance of high oxygen levels by C. elegans requires the sensory {cGMP-gated} channel tax-2/tax-4 and a specific soluble guanylate cyclase homologue, gcy-35. The {GCY-35} haem domain binds molecular oxygen, unlike the haem domains of classical nitric-oxide-regulated guanylate cyclases. {GCY-35} and {TAX-4} mediate oxygen sensation in four sensory neurons that control a naturally polymorphic social feeding behaviour in C. elegans. Social feeding and related behaviours occur only when oxygen exceeds C. elegans' preferred level, and require gcy-35 activity. Our results suggest that {GCY-35} is regulated by molecular oxygen, and that social feeding can be a behavioural strategy for responding to hyperoxic environments.},

	abstract = {The two major classes of antigen receptors on murine B lymphocytes, {mIgM} and {mIgD}, are both contained in a complex with two additional molecules, Ig-alpha and Ig-beta, which permit signal transduction. Accordingly, early biochemical events after antigen binding to either receptor are similar; biological effects, however, are different. Here, we describe three newly discovered intracellular proteins of 32, 37 and 41 {kDa} molecular mass, that are non-covalently associated with {mIgM}, but not with {mIgD.} These proteins coprecipitate with {mIgM} in Triton X-100 and Nonidet P-40, but not in digitonin lysates. In addition, {mIgM} is to some extent associated with 29 and 31 {kDa} proteins that are predominantly associated with {mIgD} (see accompanying paper). Amino acid sequencing of p32 and p37 identified p32 as mouse prohibitin; this was corroborated by Western blot analysis with antibodies specific for rat prohibitin. p37 is a newly discovered protein. {cDNA} clones for both proteins were isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of p32 is identical to that of rat prohibitin. p37 is highly homologous to p32. Since prohibitin was identified as an inhibitor of cell proliferation, its association with {mIgM}, but not {mIgD}, could explain the different biological events elicited after engagement of each receptor.},

	abstract = {Reversals of forward locomotion in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans are thought to be mediated by a common neural circuit, the touch withdrawal circuit. Despite substantial neuroanatomical changes over post-embryonic development, one reversal behavior, the head-touch withdrawal reflex, does not appear to change over development (Chalfie and Sulston, 1981). The experiments reported here indicate that two other reversal behaviors, spontaneous reversals and the tap reversal reflex to vibratory stimuli, show developmental changes. Young adult animals showed higher frequencies of spontaneous reversals than all other developmental stages, while larval stages differed from adults in their pattern of responses to tap. Although animals of all stages reversed in response to touch, taps elicited both reversals and accelerations of forward movement. In response to single taps, larval stages reversed on approximately half the occasions; young adult and 4-day-old adults almost always reversed. Increasing stimulus magnitudes increased the probability of accelerations at all developmental stages, but larval stages showed fewer reversals and more accelerations than adults. The behavioral changes observed coincide with known periods of neuroanatomical change in the touch withdrawal circuit. The addition of a late-developing sensory neuron, {AVM}, is implicated in the behavioral differences between juveniles and adults.},

Originally journals suggested deposition of data in {GDP} but by the late1980s, the majority of journals mandated deposition of data for a manuscript to be accepted for publication. A surge subsequently occurred in the number of articles retrievable from Medline and {CAPlus} using the keyword {“GenBank”.} {GPD} were not found to a new form of publication, but rather a fundamental storage and retrieval mechanism for vast amounts of molecular biology information that support the creation of scientific intellectual property. For science to continue to advance, scientists unequivocally agreed that {GDP} must remain free of peer-review and available at no charge to the public. The results suggest that the existing models of scientific communication should be updated to incorporate {GDP} data deposition into the current continuum of scientific communication.},

	abstract = {Cholesterol transport is an essential process in all multicellular organisms. In this study we applied two recently developed approaches to investigate the distribution and molecular mechanisms of cholesterol transport in Caenorhabditis elegans. The distribution of cholesterol in living worms was studied by imaging its fluorescent analog, dehydroergosterol, which we applied to the animals by feeding. Dehydroergosterol accumulates primarily in the pharynx, nerve ring, excretory gland cell, and gut of L1-L3 larvae. Later, the bulk of dehydroergosterol accumulates in oocytes and spermatozoa. Males display exceptionally strong labeling of spermatids, which suggests a possible role for cholesterol in sperm development. In a complementary approach, we used a photoactivatable cholesterol analog to identify cholesterol-binding proteins in C. elegans. Three major and several minor proteins were found specifically cross-linked to photocholesterol after {UV} irradiation. The major proteins were identified as vitellogenins. rme-2 mutants, which lack the vitellogenin receptor, fail to accumulate dehydroergosterol in oocytes and embryos and instead accumulate dehydroergosterol in the body cavity along with vitellogenin. Thus, uptake of cholesterol by C. elegans oocytes occurs via an endocytotic pathway involving yolk proteins. The pathway is a likely evolutionary ancestor of mammalian cholesterol transport.},

	abstract = {The current system of publishing in the biological sciences is notable for its redundancy, inconsistency, sluggishness, and opacity. These problems persist, and grow worse, because the peer review system remains focused on deciding whether or not to publish a paper in a particular journal rather than providing (1) a high-quality evaluation of scientific merit and (2) the information necessary to organize and prioritize the literature. Online access has eliminated the need for journals as distribution channels, so their primary current role is to provide authors with feedback prior to publication and a quick way for other researchers to prioritize the literature based on which journal publishes a paper. However, the feedback provided by reviewers is not focused on scientific merit but on whether to publish in a particular journal, which is generally of little use to authors and an opaque and noisy basis for prioritizing the literature. Further, each submission of a rejected manuscript requires the entire machinery of peer review to creak to life anew. This redundancy incurs delays, inconsistency, and increased burdens on authors, reviewers, and editors. Finally, reviewers have no real incentive to review well or quickly, as their performance is not tracked, let alone rewarded. One of the consistent suggestions for modifying the current peer review system is the introduction of some form of post-publication reception, and the development of a marketplace where the priority of a paper rises and falls based on its reception from the field (see other articles in this special topics). However, the information that accompanies a paper into the marketplace is as important as the marketplace’s mechanics. Beyond suggestions concerning the mechanisms of reception, we propose an update to the system of publishing in which publication is guaranteed, but pre-publication peer review still occurs, giving the authors the opportunity to revise their work following a mini pre-reception from the field. This step also provides a consistent set of rankings and reviews to the marketplace, allowing for early prioritization and stabilizing its early dynamics. We further propose to improve the general quality of reviewing by providing tangible rewards to those who do it well.},

	abstract = {Prohibitin is a candidate tumor suppressor gene located on human chromosome 17q21, a region of frequent loss of heterozygosity in breast cancers. We showed previously that microinjection of {RNA} encoded by the prohibitin gene 3'untranslated region ({3'UTR)} blocks the G(1)-S transition causing cell cycle arrest in several human cancer cell lines, including {MCF7.} Two allelic forms (C versus T) of the prohibitin {3'UTR} exist, and carriers of the less common variant (Tallele) with a family history of breast cancer exhibited an increased risk of breast cancer. In the present study, we examined the tumor suppressor activity of the prohibitin {3'UTR} in human breast cancer cells. Stable clones of {MCF7} cells expressing either the C allele or the T allele {RNA} under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter were isolated and compared with empty vector clones. Clones expressing the C allele {RNA} ({UTR/C)} exhibited significant suppression of growth in cell proliferation assays, inhibition of colony formation in soft agar assays, and suppression of xenograft tumor growth when implanted on nude mice, compared with either T allele expressing or empty vector clones. Immunohistochemical analyses with Ki67 staining confirmed a significant reduction in proliferation of {UTR/C} tumors. Thus, the C allele of prohibitin {3'UTR} produces a functional {RNA}, whereas a single nucleotide polymorphism creates a null allele (T allele) of which the {RNA} product has lost activity. Our data demonstrate for the first time that an {RNA} molecule functions as a tumor suppressor in human breast cancer.},

Stodden calls this method the Reproducible Research Standard, and defines it at three parts: attaching Creative Commons {BY} license to any media components, attaching a modified Berkeley Software Distribution ({BSD)} license to any code resulting from the research, and attaching a Science Commons Database Protocol for any data related to the research.

How does a specific neurotransmitter such as {GABA} control animal behaviour? To answer this question, we identified all neurons that react with antisera raised against the neurotransmitter {GABA} in the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We determined the in vivo functions of 25 of the 26 {GABAergic} neurons by killing these cells with a laser microbeam in living animals and by characterizing a mutant defective in {GABA} expression. On the basis of the ultrastructurally defined connectivity of the C. elegans nervous system, we deduced how these {GABAergic} neurons act to control the body and enteric muscles necessary for different behaviours. Our findings provide evidence that {GABA} functions as an excitatory as well as an inhibitory neurotransmitter.},

	abstract = {Background
There is increasing interest to make primary data from published research publicly available. We aimed to assess the current status of making research data available in highly-cited journals across the scientific literature.


Methods and Results
We reviewed the first 10 original research papers of 2009 published in the 50 original research journals with the highest impact factor. For each journal we documented the policies related to public availability and sharing of data. Of the 50 journals, 44 (88\%) had a statement in their instructions to authors related to public availability and sharing of data. However, there was wide variation in journal requirements, ranging from requiring the sharing of all primary data related to the research to just including a statement in the published manuscript that data can be available on request. Of the 500 assessed papers, 149 (30\%) were not subject to any data availability policy. Of the remaining 351 papers that were covered by some data availability policy, 208 papers (59\%) did not fully adhere to the data availability instructions of the journals they were published in, most commonly (73\%) by not publicly depositing microarray data. The other 143 papers that adhered to the data availability instructions did so by publicly depositing only the specific data type as required, making a statement of willingness to share, or actually sharing all the primary data. Overall, only 47 papers (9\%) deposited full primary raw data online. None of the 149 papers not subject to data availability policies made their full primary data publicly available.


Conclusion
A substantial proportion of original research papers published in high-impact journals are either not subject to any data availability policies, or do not adhere to the data availability instructions in their respective journals. This empiric evaluation highlights opportunities for improvement.},

A monoclonal antibody against stomatin was used to perform immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. The data show that stomatin concentrates preferentially in small plasma membrane protrusions. It is also found in abundance in a juxtanuclear structure possibly derived from the Golgi apparatus. Fluorescent double staining using the anti-stomatin antibody and the actin binding drug phalloidin shows a significant degree of colocalization of stomatin and cortical actin microfilaments. This association remains after actin filament disruption disruption by cytochalasin D treatment indicating a strong connection between stomatin and the membrane-associated cytoskeleton.},

	abstract = {Several molecular and histopathological prognostic markers have been proposed for the therapeutic stratification of medulloblastoma patients. Amplification of the c-myc oncogene, elevated levels of c-myc {mRNA}, or tumor anaplasia have been associated with worse clinical outcomes. In contrast, high {TrkC} {mRNA} expression generally presages longer survival. The goal of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of c-myc, N-myc and {TrkC} expression in medulloblastomas and compare them to histopathological classification. We used in situ hybridization to measure expression of these molecular markers. c-myc {mRNA} was detected in 18 of 59 (31\%) cases, and was significantly associated with shorter patient survival times on both univariate and multivariate analyses (p = 0.04). The presence of c-myc {mRNA} was also significantly associated with tumor anaplasia. While survival rates were higher for patients with low N-myc or high {TrkC} expression, these differences were not statistically significant. The group of patients with either moderate or severely anaplastic tumors showed only a trend towards shorter survival (p = 0.11). However, severe anaplasia alone was significantly prognostic (p = 0.002). Given the prognostic import of c-myc, we investigated 2 potential mechanisms by which its expression might be regulated: Wnt signaling and Mxi-1 mutation. Nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, a marker of Wnt pathway activation, was more common in medulloblastomas with high c-myc than in tumors overall, but the difference was not statistically significant. No Mxi-1 mutations were detected in the 22 cases examined. The association we describe between c-myc expression, tumor anaplasia, and worse clinical outcomes provides further evidence for the importance of this oncogene in medulloblastoma pathobiology.},

Here we show that three classes of neurons ({ASH}, {FLP}, and {OLQ)} sense touch to the nose and hence are required for this avoidance response. {ASH}, {FLP}, and {OLQ} have sensory endings that contain axonemal cilia. Mutant animals that have defective ciliated sensory endings as well as laser-operated animals that lack {ASH}, {FLP}, and {OLQ} fail to respond to touch to the nose. Together with the previous work of others, these results demonstrate that C. elegans has at least five morphologically distinct classes of mechanosensory neurons. Interestingly, the {ASH} neuron also acts as a chemosensory neuron; it mediates the avoidance of noxious chemicals. Since {ASH} possesses both chemosensory and mechanosensory modalities, this neuron might be functionally analogous to vertebrate nociceptors, which mediate the sensation of pain.},

	abstract = {The current system of publishing in the biological sciences is notable for its redundancy, inconsistency, sluggishness, and opacity. These problems persist, and grow worse, because the peer review system remains focused on deciding whether or not to publish a paper in a particular journal rather than providing (1) a high-quality evaluation of scientific merit and (2) the information necessary to organize and prioritize the literature. Online access has eliminated the need for journals as distribution channels, so their primary current role is to provide authors with feedback prior to publication and a quick way for other researchers to prioritize the literature based on which journal publishes a paper. However, the feedback provided by reviewers is not focused on scientific merit but on whether to publish in a particular journal, which is generally of little use to authors and an opaque and noisy basis for prioritizing the literature. Further, each submission of a rejected manuscript requires the entire machinery of peer review to creak to life anew. This redundancy incurs delays, inconsistency, and increased burdens on authors, reviewers, and editors. Finally, reviewers have no real incentive to review well or quickly, as their performance is not tracked, let alone rewarded. One of the consistent suggestions for modifying the current peer review system is the introduction of some form of post-publication reception, and the development of a marketplace where the priority of a paper rises and falls based on its reception from the field (see other articles in this special topics). However, the information that accompanies a paper into the marketplace is as important as the marketplace’s mechanics. Beyond suggestions concerning the mechanisms of reception, we propose an update to the system of publishing in which publication is guaranteed, but pre-publication peer review still occurs, giving the authors the opportunity to revise their work following a mini pre-reception from the field. This step also provides a consistent set of rankings and reviews to the marketplace, allowing for early prioritization and stabilizing its early dynamics. We further propose to improve the general quality of reviewing by providing tangible rewards to those who do it well.},

	abstract = {Indirect evidence on the presence of the Andean bear (Tremarctos ornatus   Cuvier, 1825) in northwestern Argentina. The presence of Andean bears   (Tremarctos ornatus) in Argentina has been disputed due to the absence   of confirming evidence. Many Andean bear experts Currently doubt on   their presence in this country. Nevertheless, the Tucuman-Bolivian   Forest or Yungas is a typical ecosystem where this species can be found,   particularly in the studied area, in which the habitat appears to be of   high quality for bears. Between 2001 and 2006, 23 cases of evidence on   the presence of Andean bears in the provinces of Salta and Jujuy were   recorded. Footprints, food remains and scats were found. In addition,   natives, farmers, and hunters where interviewed to collect new data of   this species. The conclusion is that the Yungas Forest of northwestern   Argentina must be considered an area with high probability of   maintaining a resident population of Andean bears. Although this is   probably a small and perhaps isolated population, the permanent presence   of Andean bears in northwestern Argentina might not longer be doubted.},

	abstract = {The prohibitin ({PHB)-domain} proteins are membrane proteins that regulate a variety of biological activities, including mechanosensation, osmotic homeostasis, and cell signaling, although the mechanism of this regulation is unknown. We have studied two members of this large protein family, {MEC-2}, which is needed for touch sensitivity in Caenorhabditis elegans, and Podocin, a protein involved in the function of the filtration barrier in the mammalian kidney, and find that both proteins bind cholesterol. This binding requires the {PHB} domain (including palmitoylation sites within it) and part of the N-terminally adjacent hydrophobic domain that attaches the proteins to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. By binding to {MEC-2} and Podocin, cholesterol associates with ion-channel complexes to which these proteins bind: {DEG/ENaC} channels for {MEC-2} and {TRPC} channels for Podocin. Both the {MEC-2-dependent} activation of mechanosensation and the Podocin-dependent activation of {TRPC} channels require cholesterol. Thus, {MEC-2}, Podocin, and probably many other {PHB-domain} proteins by binding to themselves, cholesterol, and target proteins regulate the formation and function of large protein-cholesterol supercomplexes in the plasma membrane.},

	abstract = {Populations of threatened taxa in captivity within their natural ranges can make important contributions to conservation, but these may be compromised by the inappropriate application of population management goals developed in other contexts. We conducted demographic, genetic, and population viability analyses on the captive population of Andean bears (Tremarctos ornatus) in Venezuela to investigate the management of within-range captive populations in general, and to better integrate this population into the conservation of Andean bears in particular. We found that although the present population is very small and not internally self-sustaining, incorporation of confiscated wild individuals has resulted in a low average number of generations in captivity and low inbreeding, with moderate gene diversity and a high probability of future population persistence. However, past imports from extra-range populations have been from over-represented lineages of unknown origin, which have mixed with under-represented Venezuelan ones, reducing the future value of the Venezuelan population as a source for founder stock. Our analyses indicate that the rate of incorporation of wild recruits is a major factor influencing proxy measures of conservation value, and distinguishing within- from extra-range populations. This implies that, contrary to conventional wisdom, internal self-sustainability can be a misguided goal in within-range populations, which furthermore may not be suitable destinations for surplus animals from captive populations elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Mathematical models of the scientific citation process predict a strong "first-mover" effect under which the first papers in a field will, essentially regardless of content, receive citations at a rate enormously higher than papers published later. Moreover papers are expected to retain this advantage in perpetuity -- they should receive more citations indefinitely, no matter how many other papers are published after them. We test this conjecture against data from a selection of fields and in several cases find a first-mover effect of a magnitude similar to that predicted by the theory. Were we wearing our cynical hat today, we might say that the scientist who wants to become famous is better off -- by a wide margin -- writing a modest paper in next year's hottest field than an outstanding paper in this year's. On the other hand, there are some papers, albeit only a small fraction, that buck the trend and attract significantly more citations than theory predicts despite having relatively late publication dates. We suggest that papers of this kind, though they often receive comparatively few citations overall, are probably worthy of our attention.},

	title = {Practices, Trends, and Recommendations in Technical Appendix Usage for Selected Data-Intensive Disciplines},
	url = {http://escholarship.org/uc/item/9jw4964t},
	abstract = {There is a need to establish a new publishing paradigm to cope with the deluge of data artifacts produced by data-intensive science, many of which are vital to data re-use and verification of published scientific conclusions. Due to the limitations of traditional publishing, most of these artifacts are not usually disseminated, cited, or preserved. These latent artifacts consist largely of datasets and data processing information that together form the foundations of the reasoned analyses that appear in the published literature. But this traditional record of science increasingly represents only the tip of the scientific iceberg. One promising approach to this problem of data invisibility is to wrap these artifacts in the metaphor of a “data paper”, a somewhat unfamiliar bundle of scholarly output with a familiar facade. As envisioned, a data paper minimally consists of a cover sheet and a set of links to archived artifacts. The cover sheet contains familiar elements such as title, authors, date, abstract, and persistent identifier (e.g., a {DOI} or {ARK)} — just enough to permit basic exposure to and discovery of data by internet search engines; also just enough to build a basic data citation, to instill confidence in the identifier’s stability, and to be picked up by indexing services such as Google Scholar. This simple format represents only the first stage of the evolution of the data paper. There is room for the format to increase in complexity with the incorporation of other valuable elements, both general-purpose and discipline-specific, to enrich discovery, re-use, and archiving. An exciting potential outcome of this development of the data paper as publication is the parallel emergence of a new kind of “data journal”. Like regular journals, data journals would spring up around disciplines and sub-disciplines as needed, and we could expect that some of them would also be peer-reviewed. The data journal is envisioned as an “overlay” journal; an editor would assemble an issue by selecting data papers from any number of source and archives, and combining them with front matter, a table of contents, editorial policies, submission guidelines, etc. This new data publishing paradigm promises to strengthen the scientific community practices of data sharing, re-use, and preservation. Scientists want to do science, get credit for it, communicate about it with their peers, and improve the measurable outputs by which their funders and employers evaluate their performance. The elements of the data paper create a recognizable and standardized form for previously unpublished data artifacts, making them easier to approach, evaluate, and automatically index for basic discovery purposes. Those same elements can easily be repurposed to create familiar-looking citations suitable for reference in {CVs} and all manner of publication. Finally, unique persistent identifiers for data papers and data artifacts greatly facilitate automatic discovery of a data paper’s impact and re-use.},

We previously identified 22 genes comprising the flp gene family that encodes {FaRPs} in Caenorhabditis elegans; in this paper we report the identification of another flp gene, flp-23. As a first step toward determining their functional roles in C. elegans, we examined the cell-specific expression pattern of the flp gene family. Of the 19 flp genes examined, each gene is expressed in a distinct set of cells; these cells include interneurons, motor neurons, and sensory neurons that are involved in multiple behaviors, as well as supporting cells, muscle cells, and epidermal cells. Several flp genes show sex-specific expression patterns. Furthermore, we find that expression of two flp genes changes in response to the developmental state of the animal. Many neurons express multiple flp genes. To investigate how flp genes are regulated in different neuronal subtypes, we examined flp expression in a small, well-defined subset of neurons, the mechanosensory neurons. Mutations in the unc-86 and mec-3 genes, which are necessary for the production and differentiation of the mechanosensory neurons, result in the complete loss of flp-4, flp-8, and flp-20 expression in mechanosensory neurons. Collectively, these data indicate that members of the flp gene family are likely to influence multiple behaviors and that their regulation can be dependent on the developmental state of the organism.},

Besides their localization at the plasma membrane, the reggies/flotillins reside at various intracellular compartments; however, the trafficking pathways used by reggie-1/flotillin-2 remain unclear. Here, we show that trafficking of reggie-1/flotillin-2 is {BFA} sensitive and that deletion mutants of reggie-1/flotillin-2 accumulate in the Golgi complex in {HeLa}, Jurkat and {PC12} cells, suggesting Golgi-dependent trafficking of reggie-1/flotillin-2. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we observed fast cycling of reggie-1/flotillin-2-positive vesicles at the plasma membrane, which engaged in transient interactions with the plasma membrane only. Reggie-1/flotillin-2 cycling was independent of clathrin, but was inhibited by cholesterol depletion and microtubule disruption. Cycling of reggie-1/flotillin-2 was negatively correlated with cell-cell contact formation but was stimulated by serum, epidermal growth factor and by cholesterol loading mediated by low density lipoproteins. However, reggie-1/flotillin-2 was neither involved in endocytosis of the epidermal growth factor itself nor in endocytosis of {GPI-GFPs} or the {GPI-anchored} cellular prion protein ({PrP(c)).} Reggie-2/flotillin-1 and stomatin-1 also exhibited cycling at the plasma membrane similar to reggie-1/flotillin-2, but these vesicles and microdomains only partially co-localized with reggie-2/flotillin-1. Thus, regulated vesicular cycling might be a general feature of {SPFH} protein-dependent trafficking.},

Following abstract is from {MIT} Press: Questions about access to scholarship go back farther than recent debates over subscription prices, rights, and electronic archives suggest. The great libraries of the past -- from the fabled collection at Alexandria to the early public libraries of nineteenth-century America -- stood as arguments for increasing access. In The Access Principle, John Willinsky describes the latest chapter in this ongoing story -- online open access publishing by scholarly journals -- and makes a case for open access as a public good.

A commitment to scholarly work, writes Willinsky, carries with it a responsibility to circulate that work as widely as possible: this is the access principle. In the digital age, that responsibility includes exploring new publishing technologies and economic models to improve access to scholarly work. Wide circulation adds value to published work; it is a significant aspect of its claim to be knowledge. The right to know and the right to be known are inextricably mixed. Open access, argues Willinsky, can benefit both a researcher-author working at the best-equipped lab at a leading research university and a teacher struggling to find resources in an impoverished high school.

Willinsky describes different types of access -- the New England Journal of Medicine, for example, grants open access to issues six months after initial publication, and First Monday forgoes a print edition and makes its contents immediately accessible at no cost. He discusses the contradictions of copyright law, the reading of research, and the economic viability of open access. He also considers broader themes of public access to knowledge, human rights issues, lessons from publishing history, and "epistemological vanities." The debate over open access, writes Willinsky, raises crucial questions about the place of scholarly work in a larger world -- and about the future of knowledge.  John Willinsky is Pacific Press Professor of Literacy and Technology at the University of British Columbia. He is the author of Empire of Words: The Reign of the {OED} and a developer of Open Journals Systems software.},

	abstract = {Research and scholarship lead to the generation of new knowledge. The dissemination of this knowledge has a fundamental impact on the ways in which society develops and progresses, and at the same time it feeds back to improve subsequent research and scholarship. Here, as in so many other areas of human activity, the internet is changing the way things work: it opens up opportunities for new processes that can accelerate the growth of knowledge, including the creation of new means of communicating that knowledge among researchers and within the wider community. Two decades of emergent and increasingly pervasive information technology have demonstrated the potential for far more effective scholarly communication. However, the use of this technology remains limited; research processes and the dissemination of research results have yet to fully assimilate the capabilities of the web and other digital media. Producers and consumers remain wedded to formats developed in the era of print publication, and the reward systems for researchers remain tied to those delivery mechanisms.

Force11 (the Future of Research Communication and e-Scholarship) is a community of scholars, librarians, archivists, publishers and research funders that has arisen organically to help facilitate the change toward improved knowledge creation and sharing. Individually and collectively, we aim to bring about a change in scholarly communication through the effective use of information technology. Force11 has grown from a small group of like-minded individuals into an open movement with clearly identified stakeholders associated with emerging technologies, policies, funding mechanisms and business models. While not disputing the expressive power of the written word to communicate complex ideas, our foundational assumption is that scholarly communication by means of semantically-enhanced media-rich digital publishing is likely to have a greater impact than communication in traditional print media or electronic facsimiles of printed works. However, to date, online versions of ‘scholarly outputs’ have tended to replicate print forms, rather than exploit the additional functionalities afforded by the digital terrain. We believe that digital publishing of enhanced papers will enable more effective scholarly communication, which will also broaden to include, for example, better links to data, the publication of software tools, mathematical models, protocols and workflows, and research communication by means of social media channels.

This document highlights the findings of the Force11 workshop on the Future of Research Communication and e-Scholarship held at Schloss Dagstuhl, Germany, in August 2011: it summarizes a number of key problems facing scholarly publishing today, and presents a vision that addresses these problems, proposing concrete steps that key stakeholders can take to improve the state of scholarly publishing. More about Force11 can be found at http://www.force11.org. This White Paper is a collaborative effort that reflects the input of all Force11 attendees at the Dagstuhl Workshop1, and is very much a living document. We see it as a starting point that will grow and be updated and augmented by individual and collective efforts by the participants and others. We invite you to join and contribute to this enterprise.},

The whole thing started with the {arXiv} server for preprints in Mathematics and Physics in 1991 and now, two decades later, ca. 25\% of all articles are freely available online immediately after acceptance,[1] just like in {JUnQ.} In biomedical research open access got a boost eight years after the start of {arXiv}, when the director of the {US} National Institute of Health ({NIH}, a main source of funding in {US} biomedical research) proposed an archive of free biomedical papers in 1999, which led to the founding of {PubMedCentral} in 2000.[1] {PubMedCentral} was an immediate and exceptional success, resulting in a call for boycott of journals that did not deposit their papers on {PubMedCentral} six months after publication. To date more than 50\% of all published articles are open access at least twelve months after publication.},

	abstract = {Scientific innovation depends on finding, integrating, and re-using the products of
previous research. Here we explore how recent developments in Web technology,
particularly those related to the publication of data and metadata, might assist that
process by providing semantic enhancements to journal articles within the mainstream
process of scholarly journal publishing. We exemplify this by describing semantic
enhancements we have made to a recent biomedical research article taken from
{PLoS} Neglected Tropical Diseases, providing enrichment to its
content and increased access to datasets within it. These semantic enhancements
include provision of live {DOIs} and hyperlinks; semantic markup of textual terms, with
links to relevant third-party information resources; interactive figures; a
re-orderable reference list; a document summary containing a study summary, a tag
cloud, and a citation analysis; and two novel types of semantic enrichment: the
first, a Supporting Claims Tooltip to permit {“Citations} in
Context”, and the second, Tag Trees that bring together semantically
related terms. In addition, we have published downloadable spreadsheets containing
data from within tables and figures, have enriched these with provenance information,
and have demonstrated various types of data fusion (mashups) with results from other
research articles and with Google Maps. We have also published machine-readable {RDF}
metadata both about the article and about the references it cites, for which we
developed a Citation Typing Ontology, {CiTO} (http://purl.org/net/cito/). The
enhanced article, which is available at http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0000228.x001, presents a
compelling existence proof of the possibilities of semantic publication. We hope the
showcase of examples and ideas it contains, described in this paper, will excite the
imaginations of researchers and publishers, stimulating them to explore the
possibilities of semantic publishing for their own research articles, and thereby
break down present barriers to the discovery and re-use of information within
traditional modes of scholarly communication.},

	abstract = {The dauer larva of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a good model system for investigating the regulation of developmental fates by environmental cues. Here we show that {SDF-9}, a protein tyrosine phosphatase-like molecule, is involved in the regulation of dauer larva formation. The dauer larva of sdf-9 mutants is different from a normal dauer larva but resembles the dauer-like larva of daf-9 and daf-12 dauer-constitutive mutants. Like these mutants, the dauer-constitutive phenotypes of sdf-9 mutants were greatly enhanced by cholesterol deprivation. Epistasis analyses, together with the relationship between sdf-9 mutations and daf-9 expression, suggested that {SDF-9} increases the activity of {DAF-9} or helps the execution of the {DAF-9} function. {SDF-9} was expressed in two head cells in which {DAF-9} is expressed. By their position and by genetic mosaic experiments, we identified these cells as {XXXL/R} cells, which are known as embryonic hypodermal cells and whose function at later stages is unknown. Killing of the sdf-9-expressing cells in the wild-type first-stage larva induced formation of the dauer-like larva. Since this study on {SDF-9} and former studies on {DAF-9} showed that the functions of these proteins are related to those of steroids, {XXXL/R} cells seem to play a key role in the metabolism or function of a steroid hormone(s) that acts in dauer regulation.},

Almost nothing is known of their wild behavior. These observations of a captive pair are the first documentation of natal den-digging and parental behavior for this taxon. The main den, excavated near the top of a 1.5 m hill, consisted of a rounded chamber about 50.8 cm deep, with an entrance about 30.5 cm high and 40.6 cm wide. The dam frequently moved the pups from the natal den to secondary locations for short periods during the day and then back to the den, starting when the pups were 2 weeks old. When the pups were between 5 and 12 weeks of age, both parents regularly regurgitated for them. The sire expressed escalating threat behavior toward the male pup starting when the pup was 5 months old, and the female began threatening the female pups at about 6 months of age. Rejection of same-sex offspring is usual for captive {NGDs} as the next breeding season approaches. Zoo Biol 30:445–450, 2011. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Contributed papers demonstrate how altmetrics can work on a personal level to enhance a scholar's {CV} and on a broad, even global level, to transform scholarly communication through its interaction with open access, digital repositories and research in emerging countries. One article suggests altmetrics should soon be included among mainstream metrics, and other contributions describe specific indicators and altmetric software considerations. The need for innovative measurement and the advantages of altmetrics in particular bode well for their wide acceptance and continuing development.},

	abstract = {Background
Disclosure of financial conflicts of interest ({COI)} is intended to help reviewers assess the impact of potential bias on the validity of research results; however, there have been no empiric assessments of how reviewers understand and use disclosures in article evaluation. We investigate reviewers' perceptions of potential bias introduced by particular author disclosures, and whether reviewer characteristics are associated with a greater likelihood of perceiving bias.


{Methodology/Principal} Findings
Of the 911 active reviewers from the Annals of Emergency Medicine, 410 were randomly selected and invited to complete our web-based, 3-part survey. We completed descriptive analysis of all survey responses and compared those responses across reviewer characteristics using 2×2 analyses and the Fisher exact test. We had a response rate of 54\%. The majority of reviewers surveyed reported a high level of skepticism regarding financial relationships between authors and industry without a clear or consistent translation of that skepticism into the self-reported actions that characterize manuscript assessment. Only 13\% of respondents believed physician consultants authoring articles based on company data are likely to have unlimited data access. 54\% believed that bias most likely exists with any honorarium, regardless of monetary amount. Between 46\% and 64\%, depending on the type of financial relationship disclosed, reported that their recommendation for publication remains unchanged. Respondents reporting personal financial ties to industry were less likely to perceive bias in industry relationships and less likely to believe that bias exists with any monetary amount of honoraria.


Conclusions
We recommend that the monetary amount of all financial relationships be reported with manuscript submissions, lead authors certify that they have unrestricted access to data, and reviewers disclose any financial ties to industry whether or not they are related to the manuscript under review. Further research is required to better understand reviewers' perceptions of financial relationships between authors and industry in order to develop clear and consistent guidelines for incorporating the perception of potential bias into manuscript assessments.},

The {hflA} locus was cloned on an 18-kilobase {DNA} fragment by selecting for plasmids that carry the neighboring {purA} gene. The boundaries of {hflA} were delimited by analysis of deletions and insertions constructed in vitro and by use of transposon Tn1000. Maxicell analysis of the proteins encoded by the {hflA-containing} fragment shows that {hflA} consists of at least two nonoverlapping genes, {hflC} and {hflK}, encoding polypeptides of 37,000 (C) and 46,000 (K) daltons. We observe that insertions into one gene eliminate the corresponding polypeptide and greatly reduce synthesis of the other. We suggest that these two polypeptides (K and C) interact to form a multimeric complex and that free subunits are unstable. We have constructed two types of fusions between {hflA} and {lacZ.} One is an {hflC-lacZ} protein fusion constructed in vitro; the other is an hfl-{lacZ} operon fusion in which a Mu {dX(Apr} lac) has inserted into the {hflK} gene. We have used the operon fusion to infer the direction of transcription of the {hflK} gene--toward {hflC} and in the same direction as {hflC.} Last, we describe evidence that {hflA} contains an additional gene, {hflX}, encoding a 50,000-dalton polypeptide.},

	volume = {22},
	lccn = {0000},
	abstract = {Few attempts have been made to estimate numbers and densities of Andean   bears (Tremarctos ornatus). It is understandable that the many   challenges involved in these efforts have made it difficult to produce   rigorous estimates. A crude estimate of [approximately]20,000 Andean   bears was derived by extrapolating the lowest observed density of   American black bears (Ursus americanus) across the range of Andean   bears. A second estimate, based on rangewide genetic diversity, produced   a wide range of values; however, the low end of the confidence interval   roughly matched the population estimate based on minimum black bear   density. A mark-recapture analysis of 3 camera-trapped bears in Bolivia   also yielded a similar density (4.4-6 bears/100 km2), but overlapping   home ranges of 2 radiocollared bears at that same site suggested a   higher density ({\textgreater}=12 bears/100 km2). Neither of these estimates can be   considered reliable or representative of the wider population because of   the small sample sizes. Moreover, the effective sampling area for the   camera-trapping study was uncertain. A {DNA} hair-trapping mark-recapture   study in Ecuador sampled a greater number of bears (n = 25) within a   larger study area, but a male-biased sex ratio suggested that closure   was violated, precluding a simple estimate of density based on the area   of the trapping grid. Also, low capture rates in what was perceived   (from incidence of bear sign) as prime bear habitat might be indicative   of a sampling bias. These issues are not simply incorporated into   confidence intervals ({CIs):} {CIs} only include uncertainty due to sampling   error, not biased sampling or an ambiguous sampling area. Whereas these   (low density) estimates may provide guidance for conservation, their   greatest usefulness may be in providing directions for improvement of   future studies of Andean bears, as well as bears in Asia, which also   lack rigorous population estimates.},

	abstract = {Background The peer review process is the gold standard by which academic manuscripts are vetted for publication. However, some investigators have raised concerns regarding its unopposed supremacy, including lack of expediency, susceptibility to editorial bias and statistical limitation due to the small number of reviewers used. Post-publication review—in which the article is assessed by the general readership of the journal instead of a small group of appointed reviewers—could potentially supplement or replace the peer-review process. In this study, we created a computer model to compare the traditional peer-review process to that of post-publication reader review. Methods We created a mathematical model of the manuscript review process. A hypothetical manuscript was randomly assigned a “true value” representing its intrinsic quality. We modeled a group of three expert peer reviewers and compared it to modeled groups of 10, 20, 50, or 100 reader-reviewers. Reader-reviewers were assumed to be less skillful at reviewing and were thus modeled to be only ¼ as accurate as expert reviewers. Percentage of correct assessments was calculated for each group. Results 400,000 hypothetical manuscripts were modeled. The accuracy of the reader-reviewer group was inferior to the expert reviewer group in the 10-reviewer trial (93.24\% correct vs. 97.67\%, p {\textless} 0.0001) and the 20-reviewer trial (95.50\% correct, p {\textless} 0.0001). However, the reader-reviewer group surpassed the expert reviewer group in accuracy when 50 or 100 reader-reviewers were used (97.92 and 99.20\% respectively, p {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusions In a mathematical model of the peer review process, the accuracy of public reader-reviewers can surpass that of a small group of expert reviewers if the group of public reviewers is of sufficient size. Further study will be required to determine whether the mathematical assumptions of this model are valid in actual use.},

	abstract = {The neural pathways for touch-induced movement in Caenorhabditis elegans contain six touch receptors, five pairs of interneurons, and 69 motor neurons. The synaptic relationships among these cells have been deduced from reconstructions from serial section electron micrographs, and the roles of the cells were assessed by examining the behavior of animals after selective killing of precursors of the cells by laser microsurgery. This analysis revealed that there are two pathways for touch-mediated movement for anterior touch (through the {AVD} and {AVB} interneurons) and a single pathway for posterior touch (via the {PVC} interneurons). The anterior touch circuitry changes in two ways as the animal matures. First, there is the formation of a neural network of touch cells as the three anterior touch cells become coupled by gap junctions. Second, there is the addition of the {AVB} pathway to the pre-existing {AVD} pathway. The touch cells also synapse onto many cells that are probably not involved in the generation of movement. Such synapses suggest that stimulation of these receptors may modify a number of behaviors.},

Lack of primary data publication is also a major obstacle to cultural heritage preservation and the goals of cultural resource management ({CRM).} Moreover, access to primary data is key to contesting claims about the past and to the formulation of credible alternative interpretations. In response to these concerns, experimental systems have implemented a variety of strategies to support online publication of primary data. Online data dissemination can be a powerful tool to meet the needs of {CRM} professionals, establish better communication and collaborative ties with colleagues in academic settings, and encourage public engagement with the documented record of the past. This paper introduces the {ArchaeoML} standard and its implementation in the Open Context system. As will be discussed, the integration and online dissemination of primary data offer great opportunities for making archaeological knowledge creation more participatory and transparent. However, different strategies in this area involve important trade-offs, and all face complex conceptual, ethical, legal, and professional challenges.},

Inspired by social networks, we propose a framework for the open exchange of post-publication evaluation to complement the current system. We first formulate a number of necessary conditions that should be met by any design dedicated to perform open scientific evaluation. To introduce our framework, we provide a basic data standard and communication protocol. We argue for the superiority of a provider-independent framework, over a few isolated implementations, which allows the collection and analysis of open evaluation content across a wide range of diverse providers like scientific journals, research institutions, social networks, publishers websites, and more. Furthermore, we describe how its technical implementation can be achieved by using existing web standards and technology. Finally, we illustrate this with a set of examples and discuss further potential.},

The projects were then undertaken to provide systems and services that support various of these primitives, with a view to developing a research infrastructure constructed from these components, which may be regarded as a ‘production line’ for humanities research, supporting research activities from the creation of primary sources in digital form through to the publication of research outputs for discussion and re-use.},

	abstract = {Eighty-two Andean bear samples obtained in three South American Andean countries were analyzed using five hypervariable microsatellite markers. Neither the overall sample nor the samples coming from each of the countries analyzed were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. This is attributable to the Wahlund effect caused by a fragmentation of the bear populations. The genetic variability levels found were in general low for this kind of molecular markers (H=0.38 for the global population). The situation of the Ecuadorian bear population seems to be endangered (H=0.24). This is the lowest level recorded for any bear population. The genetic heterogeneity among the three populations was large and highly significant ({FST=0.39;} {RST=0.32–0.49).} Likewise, the gene flow estimates were remarkably low among these populations (Nm=0.2–0.3). This means that the populations are strongly isolated. Different methods were applied to determine the effective numbers in these populations. A significant spatial structure of the genotypes was analyzed with different procedures. In all cases, an isolation-by-distance structure was detected. This could be a consequence of the original South America colonization. There was no evidence for a recent genetic bottleneck. This could mean that the low heterozygosity and the population fragmentation could be explained by ancient events related to the bear colonization, with the arrival of humans beings in the Americas, and/or with the glacial maximum, 16.000–30.000 years ago.},

The cell bodies of sensory neurons that detect such stimuli are located in the dorsal root ganglia, and subtypes of these neurons are specialized to detect specific modalities of mechanical stimuli. Molecules have been identified that are necessary for mechanosensation in invertebrates but so far not in mammals. In Caenorhabditis elegans, mec-2 is one of several genes identified in a screen for touch insensitivity and encodes an integral membrane protein with a stomatin homology domain. Here we show that about 35\% of skin mechanoreceptors do not respond to mechanical stimuli in mice with a mutation in stomatin-like protein 3 ({SLP3}, also called Stoml3), a mammalian mec-2 homologue that is expressed in sensory neurons. In addition, mechanosensitive ion channels found in many sensory neurons do not function without {SLP3.} Tactile-driven behaviours are also impaired in {SLP3} mutant mice, including touch-evoked pain caused by neuropathic injury. {SLP3} is therefore indispensable for the function of a subset of cutaneous mechanoreceptors, and our data support the idea that this protein is an essential subunit of a mammalian mechanotransducer.},

The findings suggested the up-regulation of prohibitin play an important role in the carcinogenesis of {ESCC.} The over-expression of prihibitin was significantly correlated with the depth of tumor, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, lymphatic invasion and vascular invasion of {ESCC.} These results suggested that prohibitin(+), lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis could be the independent risk factors for worse prognosis in {ESCC} patients.},

To Open Access and Open Data advocates, the web offers great opportunity for expanding the accessibility, scale, diversity and quality of archaeological communications. Nevertheless, Open Access and Open Data face steep adoption barriers. Critics wrongly see Open Access as a threat to peer review. Others see data transparency as naively technocratic and lacking in an appreciation of archaeology's social and professional incentive structure. However, as argued in this paper, the Open Access and Open Data movements do not gloss over sustainability, quality and professional incentive concerns. Rather, these reform movements offer much needed and trenchant critiques of the academy's many dysfunctions. These dysfunctions, ranging from the expectations of tenure and review committees to the structure of the academic publishing industry, go largely unknown and unremarked by most archaeologists. At a time of cutting fiscal austerity, Open Access and Open Data offer desperately needed ways to expand research opportunities, reduce costs and expand the equity and effectiveness of archaeological communication.},

In humans stomatin is missing from erythrocyte membranes in the hemolytic disease overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, despite an apparently normal stomatin gene. Overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis is characterized by alteration of the normal transmembrane gradients of sodium and potassium. Stomatin has been shown to interact genetically with sodium channels. It is also postulated that stomatin is important in the organization of lipid rafts. We demonstrate here that antibodies against {UNC-1} stain the major nerve tracts of Caenorhabditis elegans, with very intense staining of the nerve ring. We also found that a gene encoding a stomatin-like protein, {UNC-24}, affects anesthetic sensitivity and is genetically epistatic to unc-1. In the absence of {UNC-24}, the staining of the nerve ring by anti-{UNC-1} is abolished, despite normal transcriptional levels of the unc-1 {mRNA.} Western blots indicate that {UNC-24} probably affects the stability of the {UNC-1} protein. {UNC-24} may therefore be necessary for the correct placement of {UNC-1} in the cell membrane and organization of lipid rafts.},

	abstract = {We must all accept that science is data and that data are science, and thus provide for, and justify the need for the support of, much-improved data curation. (Hanson, Sugden, \& Alberts, {)Researchers} are producing an unprecedented deluge of data by using new methods and instrumentation. Others may wish to mine these data for new discoveries and innovations. However, research data are not readily available as sharing is common in only a few fields such as astronomy and genomics. Data sharing practices in other fields vary widely. Moreover, research data take many forms, are handled in many ways, using many approaches, and often are difficult to interpret once removed from their initial context. Data sharing is thus a conundrum. Four rationales for sharing data are examined, drawing examples from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities: (1) to reproduce or to verify research, (2) to make results of publicly funded research available to the public, (3) to enable others to ask new questions of extant data, and (4) to advance the state of research and innovation. These rationales differ by the arguments for sharing, by beneficiaries, and by the motivations and incentives of the many stakeholders involved. The challenges are to understand which data might be shared, by whom, with whom, under what conditions, why, and to what effects. Answers will inform data policy and practice.},

	abstract = {Independent reversions of mutations affecting three different Caenorhabditis elegans genes have each yielded representatives of the same set of extragenic suppressors. Mutations at any one of six loci act as allele-specific recessive suppressors of certain allels of unc-54 (a myosin heavy chain gene), lin-29 (a heterochronic gene), and tra-2 (a sex determination gene). The same mutations also suppress certain alleles of another sex determination gene, tra-1, and of a morphogenetic gene, dpy-5. In addition to their suppression phenotype, the suppressor mutations cause abnormal morphogenesis of the male bursa and the hermaphrodite vulva. We name these genes smg-1 through smg-6 (suppressor with morphogenetic effect on genitalia), in order to distinguish them from mab (male abnormal) genes that can mutate to produce abnormal genitalia but which do not act as suppressors (smg-1 and smg-2 are new names for two previously described genes, mab-1 and mab-11). The patterns of suppression, and the interactions between the different smg genes, are described and discussed. In general, suppression is recessive and incomplete, and at least some of the suppressed mutations are hypomorphic in nature. A suppressible allele of unc-54 contains a deletion in the 3' noncoding region of the gene; the protein coding region of the gene is apparently unaffected. This suggests that the smg suppressors affect a process other than translation, for example {mRNA} processing, transport, or stability.},

	abstract = {Abstract Physiological strategies that maximize reproductive success may be phylogenetically constrained or might have a plastic response to different environmental conditions. Among mammals, Canidae lend themselves to the study of these two influences on reproductive physiology because all the species studied to date have been characterized as monestrous (i.e., a single ovulatory event per breeding season), suggesting a phylogenetic effect. Greater flexibility could be associated with environments that are less seasonal, such as the tropics; however, little is known for many of the species from this region. To compensate for this lack of data, two regressions were done on the length of the reproductive season relative to the latitudinal distribution of a species: one with raw data and another with phylogenetically independent contrasts. There was a significant negative relationship, independent of phylogeny, with canids that have longer breeding seasons occurring at lower latitudes. In contrast, the pervasiveness of monestrus within Canidae appears to be phylogenetically constrained by their pairing/packing life and is most likely associated with monogamy. The persistence of the monestrous condition is supported by a captive study where a tropical canid, the fennec fox, Vulpes zerda, never exhibited polyestrous cycles despite a constant photoperiod ({12L:12D).}},

This axonal distribution, which is mediated by the mec-2-specific amino terminus, is disrupted by mutations in mec-12, an alpha-tubulin gene needed for touch cell function. Our results indicate that {MEC-2} links the mechanosensory channel and the microtubule cytoskeleton of the touch receptor neurons.

Although prohibitins are essential in higher eukaryotes, prohibitin-deficient yeast cells are viable and exhibit a reduced replicative life span. Here, we define the genetic interactome of prohibitins in yeast using synthetic genetic arrays, and identify 35 genetic interactors of prohibitins ({GEP} genes) required for cell survival in the absence of prohibitins. Proteins encoded by these genes include members of a conserved protein family, Ups1 and Gep1, which affect the processing of the dynamin-like {GTPase} Mgm1 and thereby modulate cristae morphogenesis. We show that Ups1 and Gep1 regulate the levels of cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine in mitochondria in a lipid-specific but coordinated manner. Lipid profiling by mass spectrometry of {GEP-deficient} mitochondria reveals a critical role of cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine for survival of prohibitin-deficient cells.

This review focuses on the most recent evidence elucidating the dynamic functions of the slit diaphragm and stresses the importance of slit diaphragm proteins in mediating signal transduction in the podocyte. {RECENT} {FINDINGS:} Nephrin and neph molecules form specialized cell junctions in various systems in different species. The organization of these specialized cell junctions is dependent on intracellular signaling networks. There is a rapidly growing number of identified adapter and signaling molecules that are recruited to this signaling network. These proteins help to maintain programs for cell survival, cell polarity and endocytosis. The latest examples of identified signaling proteins at the slit diaphragm are fyn, p85, and calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase. At the level of the slit insertion site, podocin seems to play a pivotal role in the establishment of a lipid-enriched signaling environment. Moreover, the protocadherin {FAT1} has been identified as an organizer of actin polymerization and could therefore serve as a linker of the slit diaphragm to cytoskeletal organization. {SUMMARY:} From recent data, a novel concept of a highly dynamic slit protein complex is emerging. Slit diaphragm proteins are contributing to the regulation of cell polarity, cell survival and cytoskeletal organization. This concept is further supported by the fact that many clinically relevant mutations of slit diaphragm proteins interfere with signaling processes at the slit diaphragm and cause proteinuria and progressive kidney disease.},

	abstract = {The multiple actions of sterol carrier protein-2 ({SCP-2)} in intracellular lipid circulation and metabolism originate from its gene and protein structure. The {SCP-x/pro-SCP-2} gene is a fusion gene with separate initiation sites coding for 15-{kDa} pro-{SCP-2} (no enzyme activity) and 58-{kDa} {SCP-x} (a 3-ketoacyl {CoA} thiolase). Both proteins share identical {cDNA} and amino acid sequences for 13-{kDa} {SCP-2} at their C-termini. Cellular 13-{kDa} {SCP-2} derives from complete, posttranslational cleavage of the 15-{kDa} pro-{SCP-2} and from partial posttranslational cleavage of 58-{kDa} {SCP-x.} Putative physiological functions of {SCP-2} have been proposed on the basis of enhancement of intermembrane lipid transfer (e.g., cholesterol, phospholipid) and activation of enzymes involved in fatty acyl {CoA} transacylation (cholesterol esters, phosphatidic acid) in vitro, in transfected cells, and in genetically manipulated animals. At least four important {SCP-2} structural domains have been identified and related to specific functions. First, the 46-{kDa} N-terminal presequence present in 58-{kDa} {SCP-x} is a 3-ketoacyl-{CoA} thiolase specific for branched-chain acyl {CoAs.} Second, the N-terminal 20 amino acid presequence in 15-{kDa} pro-{SCP-2} dramatically modulates the secondary and tertiary structure of {SCP-2} as well as potentiating its intracellular targeting coded by the C-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence. Third, the N-terminal 32 amino acids form an amphipathic a-helical region, one face of which represents a membrane-binding domain. Positively charged amino acid residues in one face of the amphipathic helices allow {SCP-2} to bind to membrane surfaces containing anionic phospholipids. Fourth, the hydrophobic faces of the N-terminal amphipathic a helices along with beta strands 4, 5, and helix D form a ligand-binding cavity able to accommodate multiple types of lipids (e. g., fatty acids, fatty acyl {CoAs}, cholesterol, phospholipids, isoprenoids). Two-dimensional {1H-15N} heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectra of both apo-{SCP-2} and of the 1:1 oleate-{SCP-2} complex, obtained at {pH} 6.7, demonstrated the homogenous formation of holo-{SCP-2.} While comparison of the apo- and holoprotein amide fingerprints revealed about 60\% of the resonances remaining essentially unchanged, 12 assigned amide residues underwent significant chemical-shift changes upon oleic acid binding. These residues were localized in three regions: the juncture of helices A and B, the mid-section of the beta sheet, and the interface formed by the region of beta strands 4, 5, and helix D. Circular dichroism also showed that these chemical-shift changes, upon oleic acid binding, did not alter the secondary structure of {SCP-2.} The nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift difference data, along with mapping of the nearby hydrophobic residues, showed the oleic acid-binding site to be comprised of a pocket created by the face of the beta sheet, helices A and B on one end, and residues associated with beta strands 4, 5, and helix D at the other end of the binding cavity. Furthermore, the hydrophobic nature of the previously ill-defined C-terminus suggested that these 20 amino acids may form a 'hydrophobic cap' which closes around the oleic acid upon binding. Thus, understanding the structural domains of the {SCP-x/pro-SCP-2} gene and its respective posttranslationally processed proteins has provided new insights into their functions in intracellular targeting and metabolism of lipids.},

The 17p-/17q+ copy number abnormality ({CNA)}, consistent with the formation of isochromosome 17q, was the most common event (8/22). Amplifications in this series included {MYCL}, {MYCN} and {MYC} previously implicated in medulloblastoma pathogenesis, as well as novel amplicons on chromosomes 2, 4, 11 and 12. Losses involving chromosomes 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 16 and 19 and gains of chromosomes 4, 7, 8, 9 and 18 were seen in greater than 20\% of tumors in this series. A homozygous deletion in 11p15 defines the minimal region of loss on this chromosome arm. In order to map the minimal regions involved in losses, gains and amplifications, we combined {aCGH} data from this series with that of two others obtained using the same {RPCI} {BAC} arrays. As a result of this combined analysis of 72 samples, we have defined specific regions on chromosomes 1, 8p, 10q, 11p and 16q which are frequently involved in {CNAs} in medulloblastomas. Using high density oligonucleotide expression arrays, candidate genes were identified within these consistently involved regions in a subset of the tumors.},

	abstract = {The mechanism of action of volatile anesthetics is unknown. In Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations in the gene unc-1 alter anesthetic sensitivity. The protein {UNC-1} is a close homologue of the mammalian protein stomatin. Mammalian stomatin is thought to interact with an as-yet-unknown ion channel to control sodium flux. Using both reporter constructs and translational fusion constructs for {UNC-1} and green fluorescent protein ({GFP)}, we have shown that {UNC-1} is expressed primarily within the nervous system. The expression pattern of {UNC-1} is similar to that of {UNC-8}, a sodium channel homologue. We examined the interaction of multiple alleles of unc-1 and unc-8 with each other and with other genes affecting anesthetic sensitivity. The data indicate that the protein products of these genes interact, and that an {UNC-1/UNC-8} complex is a possible anesthetic target. We propose that membrane-associated protein complexes may represent a general target for volatile anesthetics.},

To investigate this question we examined the peer-review process practiced by the interactive open access journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (based on 465 manuscripts submitted between 2004 and 2006 receiving 1,058 reviews in total). The results of the study show that inter-rater reliability is low (kappa coefficient) or reasonable (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient) in public peer review.},

Two classes of prohibitin dependent mutation (pbd1 and pbd2) were isolated and characterised. The effect of these mutations on replicative lifespan was determined, demonstrating that the pbd1 mutant slightly extended lifespan, whereas in contrast, the pbd2 mutation resulted in a shortening in both the mean- and the maximum-lifespan. The pbd1 mutation was also found to reduce chronological lifespan. Reducing the expression of the {PHB2} gene in the pbd mutants was found to retard the rate of growth and to affect replicative lifespan. As the two mutants behave in a different manner they probably affect different aspects of prohibitin function.},

Many nodes discovered using molecular data are upheld, but phenomic signals overturn molecular signals to show Sundatheria (Dermoptera + Scandentia) as the sister taxon of Primates, a close link between Proboscidea (elephants) and Sirenia (sea cows), and the monophyly of echolocating Chiroptera (bats).

To learn more about the interaction between prohibitin and the cell cycle, we studied the effect of microinjecting prohibitin {mRNA} at different points during the transition from G0 to S phase and analyzed prohibitin {mRNA} and protein levels in different parts of the cell cycle. The antiproliferative activity of microinjected prohibitin {mRNA} is high in {G0/G1} and falls as cells approach S phase. Prohibitin {mRNA} and protein levels are high in G1, fall with S phase, rise again in G2, and fall in M. Together, these findings suggest that endogenous prohibitin contributes to the control of the G1 to S transition in cycling cells in a complex manner, which involves both a transcriptional and posttranslational mechanism.},

Research on this subject has grown during the 1980s and 1990s and has increased our awareness of both the myths and facts about peer review. Part 1 summarizes research findings on the participants in the system (the appointment mechanisms of editors and referees, and reviewer tasks and qualifications) and systemic problems of reliability, accuracy, and bias. Part 2 describes current research on how fraud, favoritism, and self-interest may affect the review system and on such policy issues as interference of particularistic criteria; connections among editors, authors, and referees; and double-blind review. Although the literature indicates that peer review has many problems, the author concludes that it is difficult to imagine how science could advance without such a key quality control mechanism.},

	abstract = {{BackgroundPeer} review of grant applications has been criticized as lacking reliability. Studies showing poor agreement among reviewers supported this possibility but usually focused on reviewers’ scores and failed to investigate reasons for disagreement. Here, our goal was to determine how reviewers rate applications, by investigating reviewer practices and grant assessment {criteria.Methods} and {FindingsWe} first collected and analyzed a convenience sample of French and international calls for proposals and assessment guidelines, from which we created an overall typology of assessment criteria comprising nine domains relevance to the call for proposals, usefulness, originality, innovativeness, methodology, feasibility, funding, ethical aspects, and writing of the grant application. We then performed a qualitative study of reviewer practices, particularly regarding the use of assessment criteria, among reviewers of the French Academic Hospital Research Grant Agencies (Programmes Hospitaliers de Recherche Clinique, {PHRCs).} Semi-structured interviews and observation sessions were conducted. Both the time spent assessing each grant application and the assessment methods varied across reviewers. The assessment criteria recommended by the {PHRCs} were listed by all reviewers as frequently evaluated and useful. However, use of the {PHRC} criteria was subjective and varied across reviewers. Some reviewers gave the same weight to each assessment criterion, whereas others considered originality to be the most important criterion (12/34), followed by methodology (10/34) and feasibility (4/34). Conceivably, this variability might adversely affect the reliability of the review process, and studies evaluating this hypothesis would be of {interest.ConclusionsVariability} across reviewers may result in mistrust among grant applicants about the review process. Consequently, ensuring transparency is of the utmost importance. Consistency in the review process could also be improved by providing common definitions for each assessment criterion and uniform requirements for grant application submissions. Further research is needed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of these measures.},

Phb1p and Phb2p, members of the prohibitin family in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been implicated in the regulation of the replicative life span of the cells and in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology. The functional activities of these proteins, however, have not been elucidated. We demonstrate here that prohibitins regulate the turnover of membrane proteins by the m-{AAA} protease, a conserved {ATP-dependent} protease in the inner membrane of mitochondria. The m-{AAA} protease is composed of the homologous subunits Yta10p (Afg3p) and Yta12p (Rca1p). Deletion of {PHB1} or {PHB2} impairs growth of Deltayta10 or Deltayta12 cells but does not affect cell growth in the presence of the m-{AAA} protease. A prohibitin complex with a native molecular mass of approximately 2 {MDa} containing Phb1p and Phb2p forms a supercomplex with the m-{AAA} protease. Proteolysis of nonassembled inner membrane proteins by the m-{AAA} protease is accelerated in mitochondria lacking Phb1p or Phb2p, indicating a negative regulatory effect of prohibitins on m-{AAA} protease activity. These results functionally link members of two conserved protein families in eukaryotes to the degradation of membrane proteins in mitochondria.},

	abstract = {Slender-tailed meerkats or suricates, Suricata suricatta, are small, gregarious and largely insectivorous mongooses which inhabit the arid and semi-arid areas of southern Africa. We describe four elements of co-operative rearing of the young: 1. babysitting at the den; 2. creching on foraging trips; 3. provisioning with prey items away from the den; and 4. allonursing, including spontaneous lactation. Individual band members differed markedly in contributions to co-operative rearing. All adults and yearlings guarded the den and helpers actively defended young against predators. Breeders babysat significantly less than did non-breeding adults. Differences in age–sex class contributions were also evident in creching behaviour. The feeding of kittens by provisioners extended from soon after their first emergence from the den at 2–3 wk of age to effective foraging independence at 10–12 wk. Breeding females initially contributed little care other than nursing. Allonursing occurred in six of 25 closely observed litters, including three incidents of spontaneous lactation when subordinates nursed the young of higher-ranking females. Such co-operation is likely to be critical to the survival of these highly sociable mongooses in a semi-arid environment such as the Kalahari where food availability can fluctuate enormously.},

Many of the proteins associated with these diseases interact and localize to cilia and/or basal bodies. One of these proteins is {MKS1}, which is disrupted in some {MKS} patients and contains a B9 motif of unknown function that is found in two other mammalian proteins, {B9D2} and {B9D1.} Caenorhabditis elegans also has three B9 proteins: {XBX-7} ({MKS1)}, {TZA-1} ({B9D2)}, and {TZA-2} ({B9D1).} Herein, we report that the C. elegans B9 proteins form a complex that localizes to the base of cilia. Mutations in the B9 genes do not overtly affect cilia formation unless they are in combination with a mutation in nph-1 or nph-4, the homologues of human genes ({NPHP1} and {NPHP4}, respectively) that are mutated in some {NPHP} patients. Our data indicate that the B9 proteins function redundantly with the nephrocystins to regulate the formation and/or maintenance of cilia and dendrites in the amphid and phasmid ciliated sensory neurons. Together, these data suggest that the human homologues of the novel B9 genes {B9D2} and {B9D1} will be strong candidate loci for pathologies in human {MKS}, {NPHP}, and {JBTS.}},

Social network theory and graph theory were used to analyse this network., Main outcome measures Citation bias, amplification, and invention, and their effects on determining authority., Results The network contained 242 papers and 675 citations addressing the belief, with 220 553 citation paths supporting it. Unfounded authority was established by citation bias against papers that refuted or weakened the belief; amplification, the marked expansion of the belief system by papers presenting no data addressing it; and forms of invention such as the conversion of hypothesis into fact through citation alone. Extension of this network into text within grants funded by the National Institutes of Health and obtained through the Freedom of Information Act showed the same phenomena present and sometimes used to justify requests for funding., Conclusion Citation is both an impartial scholarly method and a powerful form of social communication. Through distortions in its social use that include bias, amplification, and invention, citation can be used to generate information cascades resulting in unfounded authority of claims. Construction and analysis of a claim specific citation network may clarify the nature of a published belief system and expose distorted methods of social citation.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The {SPFH} protein superfamily is a diverse family of proteins whose eukaryotic members are involved in the scaffolding of detergent-resistant microdomains. Recently the origin of the {SPFH} proteins has been questioned. Instead, convergent evolution has been proposed. However, an independent, convergent evolution of three large prokaryotic and three eukaryotic families is highly unlikely, especially when other mechanisms such as lateral gene transfer which could also explain their distribution pattern have not yet been {considered.To} gain better insight into this very diverse protein family, we have analyzed the genomes of 497 microorganisms and investigated the pattern of occurrence as well as the genomic vicinity of the prokaryotic {SPFH} members. {RESULTS:} According to sequence and operon structure, a clear division into 12 subfamilies was evident. Three subfamilies ({SPFH1}, {SPFH2} and {SPFH5)} show a conserved operon structure and two additional subfamilies are linked to those three through functional aspects ({SPFH1}, {SPFH3}, {SPFH4:} interaction with {FtsH} protease). Therefore these subgroups most likely share common ancestry. The complex pattern of occurrence among the different phyla is indicative of lateral gene transfer. Organisms that do not possess a single {SPFH} protein are almost exclusively endosymbionts or endoparasites. {CONCLUSION:} The conserved operon structure and functional similarities suggest that at least 5 subfamilies that encompass almost 75\% of all prokaryotic {SPFH} members share a common origin. Their similarity to the different eukaryotic {SPFH} families, as well as functional similarities, suggests that the eukaryotic {SPFH} families originated from different prokaryotic {SPFH} families rather than one. This explains the difficulties in obtaining a consistent phylogenetic tree of the eukaryotic {SPFH} members. Phylogenetic evidence points towards lateral gene transfer as one source of the very diverse patterns of occurrence in bacterial species.},

A typical example is the defecation behavior of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which repeats at about 45-sec intervals. To elucidate the mechanism, we studied flr-1 mutants, which show very short defecation cycle periods. The mutations also affect some food-related functions, including growth rate, the expulsion step of defecation behavior, and the regulation of the dauer larva (a nonfeeding, special third-stage larva) formation in the unc-3 (Olf-{1/EBF} homolog) background. The flr-1 gene encodes a novel ion channel belonging to the {DEG/ENaC} (C. elegans degenerin and mammalian epithelial sodium channel) superfamily. A flr-{1::GFP} (green fluorescent protein) fusion gene that can rescue the flr-1 mutant phenotypes is expressed only in the intestine from embryos to adults. These results suggest that {FLR-1} may be a component of an intestinal regulatory system that controls the defecation rhythm as well as other functions.},

	abstract = {Competition between females is particularly intense in cooperatively breeding mammals, where one female monopolises reproduction in each group. Chronic competition often affects stress and may therefore have long-term consequences for fitness, but no studies have yet investigated whether intrasexual competition has effects of this kind and, in particular, whether it affects rates of reproductive senescence. Here, we use long-term data from a wild population of meerkats to test whether reproductive success and senescence in dominant females are affected by the degree of intrasexual competition experienced prior to dominance acquisition. Females that experienced greater competition had lower breeding success and higher rates of reproductive senescence. Furthermore, females that were evicted from the group more frequently as subordinates had lower breeding success when dominant. We conclude that the intense intrasexual competition between females in cooperatively breeding groups may carry fitness costs over a longer period than is usually recognised.},

	abstract = {The interaction of human recombinant sterol carrier protein-2 ({SCP-2)} with sterols was examined. Two independent ligand binding methods, Lipidex 1000 binding of [{3H]cholesterol} and a fluorescent dehydroergosterol binding assay, were used to determine the affinity of {SCP-2} for sterols. Binding analysis indicated {SCP-2} bound [{3H]cholesterol} and dehydroergosterol with a Kd of 0.3 and 1.7 {microM}, respectively, and suggested the presence of a single binding site. Phase fluorometry and circular dichroism were used to characterize the {SCP-2} sterol binding site. Alterations in dehydroergosterol lifetime, {SCP-2} tryptophan lifetime, and {SCP-2} tryptophan quenching by acrylamide upon cholesterol binding demonstrated a shielding of the {SCP-2} tryptophan from the aqueous solvent by bound sterol. Differential polarized phase fluorometry revealed decreased {SCP-2} tryptophan rotational correlation time upon cholesterol binding. Circular dichroism of {SCP-2} indicated that cholesterol elicited a small decrease in {SCP-2} alpha helical content. The data suggest that {SCP-2} binds sterols with affinity consistent with a lipid transfer protein that may act either as an aqueous carrier or at a membrane surface to enhance sterol desorption.},

Yet in daily practice, the ideal of free sharing is often {breached.Objective} To understand the nature, extent, and consequences of data withholding in academic {genetics.Design}, Setting, and Participants Mailed survey (March-July 2000) of geneticists and other life scientists in the 100 {US} universities that received the most funding from the National Institutes of Health in 1998. Of a potential 3000 respondents, 2893 were eligible and 1849 responded, yielding an overall response rate of 64\%. We analyzed a subsample of 1240 self-identified geneticists and made a limited number of comparisons with 600 self-identified {nongeneticists.Main} Outcome Measures Percentage of faculty who made requests for data that were denied; percentage of respondents who denied requests; influences on and consequences of withholding data; and changes over time in perceived willingness to share {data.Results} Forty-seven percent of geneticists who asked other faculty for additional information, data, or materials regarding published research reported that at least 1 of their requests had been denied in the preceding 3 years. Ten percent of all postpublication requests for additional information were denied. Because they were denied access to data, 28\% of geneticists reported that they had been unable to confirm published research. Twelve percent said that in the previous 3 years, they had denied another academician's request for data concerning published results. Among geneticists who said they had intentionally withheld data regarding their published work, 80\% reported that it required too much effort to produce the materials or information; 64\%, that they were protecting the ability of a graduate student, postdoctoral fellow, or junior faculty member to publish; and 53\%, that they were protecting their own ability to publish. Thirty-five percent of geneticists said that sharing had decreased during the last decade; 14\%, that sharing had increased. Geneticists were as likely as other life scientists to deny others' requests (odds ratio [{OR]}, 1.39; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 0.81-2.40) and to have their own requests denied ({OR}, 0.97; 95\% {CI}, 0.69-1.40). However, other life scientists were less likely to report that withholding had a negative impact on their own research as well as their field of {research.Conclusions} Data withholding occurs in academic genetics and it affects essential scientific activities such as the ability to confirm published results. Lack of resources and issues of scientific priority may play an important role in scientists' decisions to withhold data, materials, and information from other academic geneticists.},

	abstract = {In an integrated dissemination-based information system ({DBIS)}, data are disseminated to clients in two modes. In the first mode, data publication mode, frequently accessed data are periodically pushed (published) to clients, who only need to listen to the communication channel and filter the incoming data stream for the desired objects. The second mode, demand-driven mode, employs a request-response mechanism for clients to explicitly request for data that are not published. For an integrated {DBIS} to be effective, the two modes of information dissemination must be carefully employed. For example, publishing too many data objects can lead to excessively long access time for the publication mode even when the workload (i.e., number of clients) is low. On the other hand, publishing very few data objects can lead to excessive waiting for clients using the demand-driven mode when the communication channel becomes a bottleneck. In this paper, we identify the kinds of bottleneck that may arise in an integrated {DBIS}, and propose a novel algorithm to tune such a system for “optimal” performance (in terms of average access time). We also study the effect of different feedback mechanisms that can help the server to adapt to changing access patterns. We evaluated the various proposed schemes based on a simulation model, and report our findings in this paper.},

	abstract = {Ratanmahals Wildlife Sanctuary in Gujarat State and its surrounding   areas in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh form last large block of surviving   forests (515 km2) in Malwa region which qualify for conservation on   priority under a regional/landscape conservation plan. A comprehensive   ecological and socio-economic study, including the prospect of regional   planning has been highlighted in this paper. Majority of the forest in   the proposed ecological unit is under dense forest and Ratanmahals, a   small Sanctuary, is an integral part of forest demarcated for   conservation of biodiversity. Unlike other forests in the region, forest   of the Sanctuary is relatively preserved, maintaining naturalness of the   area. Flora diversity is also high. A total of 543 species of plants,   175 species of invertebrates, 147 species of avifauna, 10 species of   amphibians, 23 species of reptiles, 28 species of mammals were recorded   in the area during the study. This study reflects an overview on floral   and faunal diversity and conservation need of the Malwa plateau in the   two states. Sloth bear and Leopard are key species and other major   mammals have low population due to hunting and food gathering habit of   the tribal and loss of habitat. Population density of Sloth bear, a   flagship species of the area, is highest in the Sanctuary in the western   part of India. Due to good population of Leopard in the region and poor   prey base of food, Leopards encounter with man and livestock has become   main issue of the wildlife management.},

These goals rely on the existence of a lively review discussion, but several experiments with open-process peer review in recent years have encountered the problem of faltering review discussions. The present article addresses the question of how lively review discussion may be fostered by relating the experience of the journal Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence ({ETAI)} which was an early experiment with open peer review. Factors influencing the discussion activity are identified. It is observed that it is more difficult to obtain lively discussion when the number of contributed articles increases, which implies difficulties for scaling up the open peer review model.

The single neuron M4 was necessary and sufficient for isthmus peristalsis. The {MC} neurons were necessary for normal stimulation of pumping in response to food, but pumping continued and was functional in {MC-} worms. The remaining 12 neuron types were also unnecessary for functional pumping. No operation we did, including destruction of the entire pharyngeal nervous system, abolished pumping altogether. When we killed all pharyngeal neurons except M4, the worms were viable and fertile, although retarded and starved. Since feeding is one of the few known essential actions controlled by the nervous system, we suggest that most of the C. elegans nervous system is dispensable in hermaphrodites under laboratory conditions. This may explain the ease with which nervous system mutants are isolated and handled in C. elegans.},

Evidence indicates that {FtsH} initiates proteolysis at the N-terminal cytosolic domain. {SecY}, having 10 transmembrane segments, is also a substrate of {FtsH.} We studied whether and how the {FtsH-catalyzed} proteolysis on the cytosolic side continues into the transmembrane and periplasmic regions using chimeric proteins, {YccA-(P3)-PhoA-His6-Myc} and {SecY-(P5)-PhoA}, with the alkaline phosphatase ({PhoA)} mature sequence in a periplasmic domain. The {PhoA} domain that was present within the fusion protein was rapidly degraded by {FtsH} when it lacked the {DsbA-dependent} folding. In contrast, both {PhoA} itself and the {TM9-PhoA} region of {SecY-(P5)-PhoA} were stable when expressed as independent polypeptides. In the presence of {DsbA}, the {FtsH-dependent} degradation stopped at a site near to the N-terminus of the {PhoA} moiety, leaving the {PhoA} domain (and its C-terminal region) undigested. The efficiency of this degradation stop correlated well with the rapidity of the folding of the {PhoA} domain. Thus, both transmembrane and periplasmic domains are degraded by the processive proteolysis by {FtsH}, provided they are not tightly folded. We propose that {FtsH} dislocates the extracytoplasmic domain of a substrate, probably using its {ATPase} activity.},

Although often sympatric, and with diets comparable as to prey taxa utilised and their rank order, foraging group size of yellow mongooses are much smaller than those of suricates and bat-eared foxes. It is argued that phylogenetic inertia, i.e. the inability to better utilize the availability of abundant, clumped prey – such as harvester termites – by resorting to group foraging, can explain the small foraging group size of yellow mongooses.},

As with many cryptic species, Andean bears had been assumed to be nocturnal, but both bears in our study were diurnal. Activity generally began around 06:00 h (near sunrise) and lasted until 20:00–21:00 h (sunset), with reduced activity during 11:00–14:00 h. Bears rested for 1–2 h during daylight hours, generally in two or more brief periods, and slept 9–12 h at night. Few differences were observed between activity patterns or time budgets during the dry season ({April–September)} and rainy season ({October–March).} Averaged across all hours and both seasons, each bear was active 53\% of the time. This level of activity was similar to that of other species of bears (generally 50–60\%), suggesting either that Andean bears are well adapted to living in an environment where fibrous bromeliads constitute the bulk of their diet or that our two study bears could subsist there only because they were both small-sized individuals.},

Bioclimatically most of the park lies in the dry zone of the country but the south west embraces the intermediate zone. The vegetation is broadly a dry monsoonal forest but forms an interesting mosaic of vegetation types from Semi evergreen forest to abandoned paddy fields, on a finer scale. The vegetation of the park was studied in detail on ground and also using aerial photographs. It was possible to classify the vegetation into many distinct types or phytosociological units, based on their cover, site characteristics, physiognomy and species composition. 1. Forests 1.1 Tall riparian forests 1.2 Semi-Evergreen forests 1.3 Hill forests 1.4 Forest of rock outcrops 1.5 High stature Monsoon forests 1.6 Degraded forests 1.7 Seral scrubland 2. Grasslands 2.1 Iluk (Imperata cylindrica) grasslands 2.2 Ischemum and Eragrostis grasslands 3. Abandoned cultivated lands 3.1 Low lying fields with remnant Manilkara and Bauhinia 3.2 Highland chenas, overgrown with Phyllanthus scrub The different types of vegetation are described. The origin and the development of the different phytosociological units are the viewed through anthropogenic, historic and environmental factors.},

	abstract = {Cellular senescence is determined by multiple factors, including the genetic regulation of metabolism and responses to endogenous and exogenous stresses [1-4]. Recent studies implicate a limited number of gene products in elongating lifespan in yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans [2-4]; these include the C, elegans gene cik-1, a central regulator of metabolism [5], and yeast {RAS2}, which controls the response to ultraviolet irradiation and other stresses [3]. Another gene postulated to effect senescence is {PHB1}, the yeast homologue of prohibitin [3], a rodent gene initially identified as a potential regulator of growth arrest and tumour suppressor [6-8]. Highly conserved prohibitin homologues have been identified in mammals [9], Drosophila [10], C. elegans [9], plants [11] and yeast. A second mammalian gene, encoding {BAP37}, a protein with sequence similarity to prohibitin, is thought to be involved in lymphocyte function [9]. Here, we show that the nuclear-encoded mammalian prohibitin and {BAP37} proteins are present in mitochondria, are co-expressed, and interact physically with each other. Deletion of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologues, {PHB1} and {PHB2}, results in a decreased replicative lifespan and a defect in mitochondrial membrane potential. Our observations highlight the relationship between the metabolic efficiency of cells and the ageing process, and provide evidence for its evolutionary conservation.},

One way to study these complex relationships is first to consider closely related species and then to generalize findings to other groups. In the present study, relationships among body size, reproductive patterns, development, and sociality were examined in 17 members of the family Canidae (canids). Large canids are more social than smaller species, and offspring of large species achieve independence and tend to breed first at a later age. Large females give birth to absolutely larger young, but relative to their own body weight they allocate fewer resources to bringing a large pup to term. Overall, sexual dimorphism in size is small to moderate, and this is associated with monogamous mating habits and paternal care of young.},

In this study, I use bibliometric methods to understand the prevalence and patterns with which investigators publicly share their raw gene expression microarray datasets after study {publication.Automated} methods were used to identify 11,603 published studies that created gene expression microarray data. At least 25\% of these studies have datasets in one of the two predominant public databases for microarray data, increasing from 5\% in 2001 to 35\% in 2009. Fifteen factors that described authorship, funding, institution, publication, and domain environments were derived from 124 article attributes. Most factors associated with the prevalence of data sharing (p{\textless}0.01). In particular, publishing in a journal with a relatively strong data sharing policy, receiving funding from many {NIH} grants, publishing in an open access journal, and having prior experience sharing gene expression data were associated with the highest data sharing rates. In contrast, increased first author age and experience, having no experience reusing data, and studying cancer and human subjects were associated with the lowest data sharing {rates.In} second-order factor analysis, previously sharing gene expression microarray data was most positively associated with high data sharing rates, whereas publishing a study on cancer or human subjects was strongly associated with a negative probability of data {sharing.I} hope these methods and results will contribute to a deeper understanding of data sharing behavior and eventually more effective data sharing initiatives.},

By choosing promoters whose expression patterns overlap for a single cell type, we can produce animals with fluorescence only in those cells.

Second, we analyzed the association between the decisions (n = 677 accepted or rejected, but published elsewhere manuscripts) or ratings (reviewers' ratings for n = 315 manuscripts), respectively, and the citation impact classes of the manuscripts.

	abstract = {Prohibitin proteins have been implicated in cell proliferation, aging, respiratory chain assembly and the maintenance of mitochondrial integrity. The prohibitins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Phb1 and Phb2, have strong sequence similarity with their human counterparts prohibitin and {BAP37}, making yeast a good model organism in which to study prohibitin function. Both yeast and mammalian prohibitins form high-molecular-weight complexes (Phb1/2 or {prohibitin/BAP37}, respectively) in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Expression of prohibitins declines with senescence, both in mammalian fibroblasts and in yeast. With a total loss of prohibitins, the replicative (budding) life span of yeast is reduced, whilst the chronological life span (the survival of stationary cells over time) is relatively unaffected. This effect of prohibitin loss on the replicative life span is still apparent in the absence of an assembled respiratory chain. It also does not reflect the production of extrachromosomal ribosomal {DNA} circles ({ERCs)}, a genetic instability thought to be a major cause of replicative senescence in yeast. Examination of cells containing a mitochondrially targeted green fluorescent protein indicates this shortened life span is a reflection of defective mitochondrial segregation from the mother to the daughter in the old mother cells of phb mutant strains. Old mother phb mutant cells display highly aberrant mitochondrial morphology and, frequently, a delayed segregation of mitochondria to the daughter. They often arrest growth with their last bud strongly attached and with the mitochondria adjacent to the septum between the mother and the daughter cell.},

Although the crucial feature is the coexistence of phase-separated fluid domains, direct evidence for this in mixtures of cholesterol with a single lipid is extremely sparse. More extensive evidence comes from ternary mixtures of a high chain-melting lipid and a low chain-melting lipid with cholesterol, including those containing sphingomyelin that are taken to be a raft paradigm. There is, however, not complete agreement between the various phase diagrams and their interpretation. In this review, the different ternary phase diagrams of cholesterol-containing systems are presented in a uniform way, using simple x,y-coordinates to increase accessibility for the non-specialist. It is then possible to appreciate the common features and examine critically the discrepancies and hence what direct biophysical evidence there is that supports the raft concept.},

The {RNA} processing factor {MEC-8} is necessary for the function of the Caenorhabditis elegans touch receptor neurons; mec-8 mutants are touch insensitive. We show here that this insensitivity involves the loss of {MEC-8-dependent} splicing of mec-2, which encodes a component of the mechanosensory transduction complex. {MEC-8} is needed to remove the ninth intron in mec-2 pre-{mRNA} to form the longest of three {mRNAs}, mec-2a. Without {MEC-8}, splicing causes the termination of the transcript. Inclusion of mec-2 intron 9 is sufficient to convey mec-8-dependent regulation on other genes and, in mec-8(u218ts) mutants, resulted in their temperature-dependent expression. Because mec-8 is expressed ubiquitously in embryos and extensively in larvae, this system should produce temperature-sensitive expression for most genes. As an example, we report a strain that exhibits temperature-dependent {RNA} interference.},

In Multivulva mutants, which define ten genes, one or more supernumerary vulva-like protrusions are located along the ventral side of the animal. A single recessive mutation is responsible for the phenotypes of most, but not all, of these strains. Fifteen of these 22 genes are represented by multiple alleles. We have shown by a variety of genetic criteria that mutations that result in a Vulvaless or Multivulva phenotype in six of the 22 genes most likely eliminate gene function. In addition, Vulvaless or Multivulva mutations in seven of the other genes most likely result in a partial reduction of gene function; the absence of the activity of any of these genes probably results in lethality or sterility.

	title = {{Faculty/Researcher} Survey on Data Curation},

	abstract = {In 2012 the Data Curation @ {UCSB} Project surveyed {UCSB} campus faculty and researchers on the subject of data curation, with the goals of 1) better understanding the scope of the digital curation problem and the curation services that are needed, and 2) characterizing the role that the {UCSB} Library might play in supporting curation of campus research outputs. The project received responses from one-third of the estimated target audience of 900, indicating great interest in the topic and yielding statistically significant results. To summarize the survey's findings:

    Curation of digital data is a concern for a significant proportion of {UCSB} faculty and researchers.
    Curation of digital data is a concern for almost every department and unit on campus.
    Researchers almost universally view themselves as personally responsible for the curation of their data.
    Researchers view curation as a collaborative activity and collective responsibility.
    Departments have different curation requirements, and therefore may require different amounts and types of campus support.
    Researchers desire help with all data management activities related to curation, predominantly storage.
    Researchers may be underestimating the need for help using archival storage systems and dealing with attendant metadata issues.
    There are many sources of curation mandates, and researchers are increasingly under mandate to curate their data.
    Researchers under curation mandate are more likely to collaborate with other parties in curating their data, including with their local labs and departments.
    Researchers under curation mandate request more help with all curation-related activities; put another way, curation mandates are an effective means of raising curation awareness.
    The survey reflects the concerns of a broad cross-section of campus.

These findings echo and complement similar surveys performed by other higher education institutions, including surveys at the University of Colorado, Boulder [4], California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo [7], Georgia Tech [8], and University of Oxford [9], as well as the Digital Curator Vocational Education Europe ({DigCurV)} Project [2].

Taken together, these findings argue for the establishment of a campus unit possessing data curation expertise and providing curation-related assistance to campus researchers, and possibly hosting curation services (as necessary and as funding allows).},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The response to gentle body touch in C. elegans requires a degenerin channel complex containing four proteins ({MEC-2}, {MEC-4}, {MEC-6}, and {MEC-10).} The central portion of the integral membrane protein {MEC-2} contains a stomatin-like region that is highly conserved from bacteria to mammals. The molecular function of this domain in {MEC-2}, however, is unknown. {RESULTS:} Here, we show that {MEC-2} colocalizes with the degenerin {MEC-4} in regular puncta along touch receptor neuron processes. This punctate localization requires the other channel complex proteins. The stomatin-like region of {MEC-2} interacts with the intracellular cytoplasmic portion of {MEC-4.} Missense mutations in this region that destroy the interaction also disrupt the punctate localization and degenerin-regulating function of {MEC-2.} Missense mutations outside this region apparently have no effect on the punctate localization but significantly reduce the regulatory effect of {MEC-2} on the {MEC-4} degenerin channel. A second stomatin-like protein, {UNC-24}, colocalizes with {MEC-2} in vivo and coimmunoprecipitates with {MEC-2} and {MEC-4} in Xenopus oocytes; unc-24 enhances the touch insensitivity of temperature-sensitive alleles of mec-4 and mec-6. {CONCLUSION:} Two stomatin homologs, {MEC-2} and {UNC-24}, interact with the {MEC-4} degenerin through their stomatin-like regions, which act as protein binding domains. At least in the case of {MEC-2}, this binding allows its nonstomatin domains to regulate channel activity. Stomatin-like regions in other proteins may serve a similar protein binding function.},

We demonstrate that functions of the six C. elegans smg genes are necessary for rapid turnover of nonsense mutant {mRNAs} of the unc-54 myosin heavy chain gene. Nonsense alleles of unc-54 express {mRNAs} that are unstable in smg(+) genetic backgrounds but have normal or near normal stability in smg(-) backgrounds. smg mutations also stabilize {mRNA} of unc-54(r293), a small deletion that removes the unc-54 polyadenylation site and expresses an aberrant {mRNA.} Most unc-54 nonsense mutations are recessive in both smg(+) and smg(-) genetic backgrounds. However, four specific alleles are recessive when smg(+) and dominant when smg(-). These smg-dependent dominant alleles express nonsense mutant polypeptides that disrupt thick filament and/or sarcomere assembly. All four alleles are predicted to express nonsense fragment polypeptides that contain most of the myosin globular head domain without an attached rod segment. By degrading messages that contain premature stop codons, the smg genes eliminate {mRNAs} that encode potentially toxic protein fragments. We propose that this system of {mRNA} turnover protects cells from their own errors of transcription, {mRNA} processing, or {mRNA} transport.},

Specifically, in eight months, this project resulted in 1) a data curation workflow utilizing existing university resources; 2) five pilot research datasets that were solicited, selected, and curated for discovery and reuse in the libraries’ digital repository, the University Digital Conservancy, at the persistent {URL}, http://purl.umn.edu/160292; and 3) and a summary report describing the successes and shortcomings of this approach.

This report summarizes the steps taken to curate the datasets in the pilot, faculty needs and reactions to the result, and in addition to the specific dataset treatments, an overall data curation workflow is presented that outlines the steps needed for any dataset. A discussion of this process provides some useful lessons learned. As a result of this project, the University Libraries now hold a more realistic sense of the overall capacities and expertise needed to develop a sustainable data curation service model. Additionally, the Libraries are better prepared to fine-tune and implement selected recommendations from previous assessments and committee reports.},

In vivo imaging of the fluorescent sterol, dehydroergosterol ({DHE)} is challenged by C. elegans' high autofluorescence in the same spectral region as emission of {DHE.} We present a method to detect {DHE} selectively based on its rapid bleaching kinetics compared to cellular autofluorescence. Worms were repeatedly imaged on an ultraviolet-sensitive wide field ({UV-WF)} microscope, and bleaching kinetics of {DHE} fitted on a pixel-basis to mathematical models describing the intensity decay. Bleach rate constants were determined for {DHE} in vivo and confirmed in model membranes. Using this method, we could detect enrichment of {DHE} in specific tissues like the nerve ring, the spermateca and oocytes. We confirm these results in C. elegans gut-granule-loss (glo) mutants with reduced autofluorescence and compare our method with three-photon excitation microscopy of sterol in selected tissues. Bleach-rate based {UV-WF} imaging is a useful tool for genetic screening experiments on sterol transport, as exemplified by {RNA} interference against the rme-2 gene coding for the yolk receptor and for worm homologs of Niemann-Pick C disease proteins. Our approach is generally useful for identifying fluorescent probes in the presence of high cellular autofluorescence.},

Certain types of protein lipidation are known to cause the lipoprotein to sequester with cholesterol and to stabilize cholesterol-rich domains. However, proteins that are excluded from such domains also contribute to the redistribution of cholesterol. One of the motifs that favor interaction with cholesterol is the {CRAC} motif. The role of the {CRAC} motif of the gp41 fusogenic protein of {HIV} is discussed. The distribution of the multianionic lipid, phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bis-phosphate ({PtnIns(4}{,5)P2)}, is also not uniform in cell membranes. This lipid has several functions in the cell, including a morphological role in determining the sites of attachment of the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. {PtnIns(4}{,5)P2} is sequestered by proteins having clusters of cationic residues in their sequence. Certain proteins containing cationic clusters also contain moieties such as myristoylation or a {CRAC} segment that would also endow them with the ability to sequester to a cholesterol-rich domain. These proteins interact with {PtnIns(4}{,5)P2} in a cholesterol-dependent manner forming domains that are enriched in both cholesterol and in {PtnIns(4}{,5)P2} but can also be distinct from liquid-ordered raft-like domains.},

	abstract = {Background
Scientific research in the 21st century is more data intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study the data practices of researchers – data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results. 

{Methodology/Principal} Findings
A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region. 

{Conclusions/Significance}
Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from {NSF} and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes. Large scale programs, such as the {NSF-sponsored} {DataNET} (including projects like {DataONE)} will both bring attention and resources to the issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management principles.},

	abstract = {Although sphingolipids are highly important signaling molecules enriched in lipid rafts/caveolae, relatively little is known regarding factors such as sphingolipid binding proteins that may regulate the distribution of sphingolipids to lipid rafts/caveolae of living cells. Since early work demonstrated that sterol carrier protein-2 ({SCP-2)} enhanced glycosphingolipid transfer from membranes in vitro, the effect of {SCP-2} expression on sphingolipid distribution to lipid rafts/caveolae in living cells was examined. Using a non-detergent affinity chromatography method to isolate lipid rafts/caveolae and non-rafts from purified L-cell plasma membranes, it was shown that lipid rafts/caveolae were highly enriched in multiple sphingolipid species including ceramides, acidic glycosphingolipids (ganglioside {GM1);} neutral glycosphingolipids (monohexosides, dihexosides, globosides), and sphingomyelin as compared to non-raft domains. {SCP-2} overexpression further enriched the content of total sphingolipids and select sphingolipid species in the lipid rafts/caveolae domains. Analysis of fluorescence binding and displacement data revealed that purified human recombinant {SCP-2} exhibited high binding affinity (nanomolar range) for all sphingolipid classes tested. The binding affinity decreased in the following order: ceramides {\textgreater} acidic glycosphingolipid (ganglioside {GM1)} {\textgreater} neutral glycosphingolipid (monohexosides, hexosides, globosides) {\textgreater} sphingomyelin. Enrichment of individual sphingolipid classes to lipid rafts/caveolae versus non-rafts in {SCP-2} expressing plasma membranes followed closely with those classes most strongly bound to {SCP-2} (ceramides, {GM1} {\textgreater} the neutral glycosphingolipids (monohexosides, dihexosides, and globosides) {\textgreater} sphingomyelin). Taken together these data suggested that {SCP-2} acts to selectively regulate sphingolipid distribution to lipid rafts/caveolae in living cells.},

As a highly specialized cell-cell contact the slit diaphragm has recently been appreciated as a signaling platform that regulates podocyte cell survival, polarity, endocytosis and cytoskeletal organization. Mutations in genes encoding slit diaphragm proteins contribute to human hereditary glomerular diseases. Recently, it was discovered that transient receptor potential ion channel {TRPC6} mutations cause familial glomerular disease. {TRPC6} localizes to the slit diaphragm unexpectedly adding an ion channel to the list of signaling molecules functioning at this complex structure. Recent findings highlight a potential role for {TRPC6} at the filtration barrier. {TRPC6} has been identified as a sensor of mechanically and osmotically induced membrane stretch. In the context of the slit diaphragm signaling network, {TRPC6} is clustered and regulated by a podocin-lipid complex that might translate mechanical tension to ion channel action.

	abstract = {In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content: In the spring of 2008, the National Endowment for the Humanities converted its Digital Humanities Initiative to the more permanent Office of Digital Humanities. Along with other leadership organizations like the Mellon Foundation and the American Council of Learned Societies, the {NEH} actively promotes new digitally enabled forms of research, publication, and pedagogy. Such emerging paradigms respond to ongoing shifts in an increasingly (if unevenly) networked public culture, seeking to adapt for scholarly gains the core technologies and social practices unfolding in online spaces ranging from Wikipedia to {YouTube} to Second Life. Of course, what is now called the "digital humanities" is not a new development. Indeed, a small subset of humanities scholars have been actively engaged in working with computer technology for over twenty years. Nonetheless, these "computing humanists" sometimes labored in relative isolation from the questions that animated research in other aspects of their home disciplines, particularly work derived from interpretative frameworks or from poststructuralist theories. Their efforts often concentrated on archiving, digitizing, and preserving the human record, i.e., on large infrastructural projects that could seem more the terrain of libraries than of "scholarship proper." More recently, we have seen an explosion of what I might call the "blogging humanists"—folks very interested in the hopes for participation promised by emerging Web 2.0 technologies. Faced with severe cutbacks at academic presses and dated systems for peer review, this second breed of digital humanists port the words and monographs of humanities scholarship to networked spaces of conversation and dialogue. They envision new modes of connection and peer-to-peer conversation, and text often remains the lingua franca of their scholarly productions. Through the decades, this humanities computing work has been quietly building momentum; the scholarly fields of media studies, visual studies, and digital studies have exploded, producing valuable insights into the epistemological, phenomenological, ethical, and cultural dimensions of the visually intense and media-rich worlds we inhabit. Indeed, some of today's most cutting-edge humanities research takes up questions of visual and aural culture and of the emotions. Nonetheless, we have been slow to explore the potential of interactive, immersive, and multimedia expression for our own thinking and scholarship, even as we dabble with such forms in our teaching. With a few exceptions, we remain content to comment about technology and media, rather than to participate more actively in constructing knowledge in and through our objects of study. The time is now ripe to join the insights of decades of film and media studies with the new modes of information management, visualization, and dissemination that digital technologies are enabling. Who better to reimagine the relationship of scholarly form to content than those who have devoted their careers to studying narrative structure, representation and meaning, or the aesthetics of visuality? Who better to address the utopian registers of much popular commentary on technology than historians of media and scholars of political economy? In the late 1990s, fueled by the siren call and profit-driven dreams of "distance learning," administrators at many of our universities reduced the role of the humanities scholar to "content provider" for the digitally enhanced university. In this scenario, our lectures and research would populate their information systems. I am here suggesting that we should reject this limited role for the humanities scholar and instead fully engage with the platforms and tools of the digital era. This will require new forms of collaboration and engagement that may push us beyond our scholarly comfort zones. It also means rethinking our allegiance to print as the only (or even the primary) outcome of our scholarly endeavors. One potentially rich space for action for the media studies professor is in a third variant of the digital humanities, the multimodal scholar. This third type of digital humanist in effect blends many of the desires and goals of the other "early adopters," the computing humanist and blogging humanist. This emergent breed, the multimodal humanist, brings together databases, scholarly tools, networked writing, and peer-to-peer commentary while also leveraging the potential of visual and aural media that so dominate contemporary life. This multimodal scholar complements rather than replaces other types of digital humanists, expanding the scope and reach of...},

	abstract = {Background Head \& Face Medicine ({HFM)} was launched in August 2005 to provide multidisciplinary science in the field of head and face disorders with an open access and open peer review publication platform. The objective of this study is to evaluate the characteristics of submissions, the effectiveness of open peer reviewing, and factors biasing the acceptance or rejection of submitted manuscripts. Methods A 1-year period of submissions and all concomitant journal operations were retrospectively analyzed. The analysis included submission rate, reviewer rate, acceptance rate, article type, and differences in duration for peer reviewing, final decision, publishing, and {PubMed} inclusion. Statistical analysis included Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square test, regression analysis, and binary logistic regression. Results {HFM} received 126 articles (10.5 articles/month) for consideration in the first year. Submissions have been increasing, but not significantly over time. Peer reviewing was completed for 82 articles and resulted in an acceptance rate of 48.8\%. In total, 431 peer reviewers were invited (5.3/manuscript), of which 40.4\% agreed to review. The mean peer review time was 37.8 days. The mean time between submission and acceptance (including time for revision) was 95.9 days. Accepted papers were published on average 99.3 days after submission. The mean time between manuscript submission and {PubMed} inclusion was 101.3 days. The main article types submitted to {HFM} were original research, reviews, and case reports. The article type had no influence on rejection or acceptance. The variable 'number of invited reviewers' was the only significant (p {\textless} 0.05) predictor for rejection of manuscripts. Conclusion The positive trend in submissions confirms the need for publication platforms for multidisciplinary science. {HFM's} peer review time comes in shorter than the 6-weeks turnaround time the Editors set themselves as the maximum. Rejection of manuscripts was associated with the number of invited reviewers. None of the other parameters tested had any effect on the final decision. Thus, {HFM's} ethical policy, which is based on Open Access, Open Peer, and transparency of journal operations, is free of 'editorial bias' in accepting manuscripts.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The gene unc-1 plays a central role in determining volatile anesthetic sensitivity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Because different unc-1 alleles cause strikingly different phenotypes in different volatile anesthetics, the {UNC-1} protein is a candidate to directly interact with volatile anesthetics. {UNC-1} is a close homologue of the mammalian protein stomatin, for which a mouse knockout was recently constructed. Because the stomatin gene is expressed in dorsal root ganglion cells, the authors hypothesized that the knockout would have an effect on anesthetic sensitivity in mice similar to that seen in nematodes. {METHODS:} Mice were placed in semiclosed chambers and exposed to continuous flows of diethyl ether, halothane, or isoflurane in air. Using lack of response to tail clamp as an endpoint, the authors determined the {EC50s} for the knockout strain compared with the nonmutated parental strain. They compared the differences seen in the mouse strains with the differences seen in the nematode strains. {RESULTS:} Stomatin-deficient mice had a 12\% increase in sensitivity to diethyl ether but no significant change in sensitivity to halothane or isoflurane compared with wild type. No defect in locomotion was noted in the mutant mouse. {CONCLUSIONS:} Nematodes and mice with deletions of the stomatin gene both have increased sensitivity to diethyl ether. Neither nematodes nor mice with stomatin deficiencies have significantly altered sensitivity to isoflurane or halothane. The effects of stomatin deficiency cross phylogenetic boundaries and support the importance of this protein in anesthetic response and the use of C. elegans as a model for anesthetic action in mammals.},

	abstract = {The traditional forms of scientific publishing and peer review do not live up to all demands of efficient communication and quality assurance in today’s highly diverse and rapidly evolving world of science. They need to be advanced and complemented by interactive and transparent forms of review, publication, and discussion that are open to the scientific community and to the public. The advantages of open access, public peer review, and interactive discussion can be efficiently and flexibly combined with the strengths of traditional scientific peer review. Since 2001 the benefits and viability of this approach are clearly demonstrated by the highly successful interactive open access journal Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics ({ACP}, www.atmos-chem-phys.net) and a growing number of sister journals launched and operated by the European Geosciences Union ({EGU}, www.egu.eu) and the open access publisher Copernicus (www.copernicus.org). The interactive open access journals are practicing an integrative multi-stage process of publication and peer review combined with interactive public discussion, which effectively resolves the dilemma between rapid scientific exchange and thorough quality assurance. Key features and achievements of this approach are: top quality and impact, efficient self-regulation and low rejection rates, high attractivity and rapid growth, low costs, and financial sustainability. In fact, {ACP} and the {EGU} interactive open access sister journals are by most if not all standards more successful than comparable scientific journals with traditional or alternative forms of peer review (editorial statistics, publication statistics, citation statistics, economic costs, and sustainability). The high efficiency and predictive validity of multi-stage open peer review have been confirmed in a series of dedicated studies by evaluation experts from the social sciences, and the same or similar concepts have recently also been adopted in other disciplines, including the life sciences and economics. Multi-stage open peer review can be flexibly adjusted to the needs and peculiarities of different scientific communities. Due to the flexibility and compatibility with traditional structures of scientific publishing and peer review, the multi-stage open peer review concept enables efficient evolution in scientific communication and quality assurance. It has the potential for swift replacement of hidden peer review as the standard of scientific quality assurance, and it provides a basis for open evaluation in science.},

Here, we show that reggies regulate axon regeneration in zebrafish ({ZF)} after optic nerve section ({ONS)} in vivo as well as axon/neurite extension in hippocampal and N2a neurons in vitro through signal transduction molecules modulating actin dynamics. {ZF} reggie-1a, -2a, and -2b downregulation by reggie-specific morpholino (Mo) antisense oligonucleotides directly after {ONS} significantly reduced {ZF} {RGC} axon regeneration: {RGC} axons from reggie Mo retinas were markedly reduced. Moreover, the number of axon-regenerating {RGCs}, identified by insertion of A488-coupled dextran, decreased by 69\% in retinas 7 d after Mo application. At 10 and 14 d, {RGCs} decreased by 53 and 33\%, respectively, in correlation with the gradual inactivation of the Mos. {siRNA-mediated} knockdown of reggie-1 and -2 inhibited the differentiation and axon/neurite extension in hippocampal and N2a neurons. N2a cells had significantly shorter filopodia, more cells had lamellipodia and fewer neurites, defects which were rescued by a reggie-1 construct without {siRNA-binding} sites. Furthermore, reggie knockdown strongly perturbed the balanced activation of the Rho family {GTPases} Rac1, {RhoA}, and cdc42, influenced the phosphorylation of cortactin and cofilin, the formation of the N-{WASP}, cortactin and Arp3 complex, and affected p38, Ras, {ERK1/2} (extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2), and focal adhesion kinase activation. Thus, as suggested by their prominent re-expression after lesion, the reggies represent neuron-intrinsic factors for axon outgrowth and regeneration, being crucial for the coordinated assembly of signaling complexes regulating cytoskeletal remodeling.},

Various roles in different cellular compartments have been proposed for prohibitin proteins. Recent experiments, however, identify large assemblies of two homologous prohibitin subunits, {PHB1} and {PHB2}, in the inner membrane of mitochondria as the physiologically active structure. Mitochondrial prohibitin complexes control cell proliferation, cristae morphogenesis and the functional integrity of mitochondria. The processing of the dynamin-like {GTPase} {OPA1}, a core component of the mitochondrial fusion machinery, has been defined as a key process affected by prohibitins. The molecular mechanism of prohibitin function, however, remained elusive. The ring-like assembly of prohibitins and their sequence similarity with lipid raft-associated {SPFH-family} members suggests a scaffolding function of prohibitins, which may lead to functional compartmentalization in the inner membrane of mitochondria.},

	abstract = {This report describes a new transposon designed to facilitate the combined use of beta-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase gene fusions in the analysis of protein localization. The transposon, called {TnlacZ}, is a Tn5 derivative that permits the generation of gene fusions encoding hybrid proteins carrying beta-galactosidase at their C termini. In tests with plasmids, {TnlacZ} insertions that led to high cellular beta-galactosidase activity were restricted to sequences encoding either cytoplasmic proteins or cytoplasmic segments of a membrane protein. The fusion characteristics of {TnlacZ} are thus complementary to those of {TnphoA}, a transposon able to generate alkaline phosphatase fusions whose high-activity insertion sites generally correspond to periplasmic sequences. The structure of {TnlacZ} allows the conversion of a {TnlacZ} fusion into the corresponding {TnphoA} fusion (and vice versa) through recombination or in vitro manipulation in a process called fusion switching. Fusion switching was used to generate the following two types of fusions with unusual properties: a low-specific-activity beta-galactosidase-alkaline phosphatase gene fusion and two toxic periplasmic-domain serine chemoreceptor-beta-galactosidase gene fusions. The generation of both beta-galactosidase and alkaline phosphatase fusions at exactly the same site in a protein permits a comparison of the two enzyme activities in evaluating the subcellular location of the site, such as in studies of membrane protein topology. In addition, fusion switching makes it possible to generate gene fusions whose properties should facilitate the isolation of mutants defective in the export or membrane anchoring of different cell envelope proteins.},

How can a library-based bioinformatics support program be implemented and expanded to continuously support the growing and changing needs of the research community?

Setting:
A program at a health sciences library serving a large academic medical center with a strong research focus is described.

Methods:
The bioinformatics service program was established at the Norris Medical Library in 2005. As part of program development, the library assessed users' bioinformatics needs, acquired additional funds, established and expanded service offerings, and explored additional roles in promoting on-campus collaboration.

Results:
Personnel and software have increased along with the number of registered software users and use of the provided services.

Conclusion:
With strategic efforts and persistent advocacy within the broader university environment, library-based bioinformatics service programs can become a key part of an institution's comprehensive solution to researchers' ever-increasing bioinformatics needs.},

A number of 4-desmethylsterols with a trans-{A/B} ring configuration can satisfy the steroid nutritional requirement in C. elegans, but sterols with a cis-{A/B} ring configuration or trans-{A/B} sterols with a 4-methyl group cannot. C. elegans removes methyl or ethyl substituents at C-24 of the plant sterols sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, stigmastanol, and 24-methylene-cholesterol to produce various sterols with structures partially dependent upon that of the dietary sterol. Additional metabolic steps in C. elegans include reduction of Delta(2)(2)- and Delta-bonds, C-7 dehydrogenation, isomerization of a Delta-bond to a Delta(1)-bond, and 4alpha-methylation. An azasteroid and several long-chain alkyl amines interfere with the dealkylation pathway in C. elegans by inhibiting the Delta(2)-sterol reductase; these compounds also inhibit growth and reproduction in various plant-parasitic and animal-parasitic nematodes. A possible hormonal role for various steroids identified in nematodes is discussed.},

	abstract = {Sorting of transmembrane proteins to endosomes and lysosomes is mediated by signals present within the cytosolic domains of the proteins. Most signals consist of short, linear sequences of amino acid residues. Some signals are referred to as tyrosine-based sorting signals and conform to the {NPXY} or {YXXO} consensus motifs. Other signals known as dileucine-based signals fit [{DE]XXXL[LI]} or {DXXLL} consensus motifs. All of these signals are recognized by components of protein coats peripherally associated with the cytosolic face of membranes. {YXXO} and [{DE]XXXL[LI]} signals are recognized with characteristic fine specificity by the adaptor protein ({AP)} complexes {AP-1}, {AP-2}, {AP-3}, and {AP-4}, whereas {DXXLL} signals are recognized by another family of adaptors known as {GGAs.} Several proteins, including clathrin, {AP-2}, and Dab2, have been proposed to function as recognition proteins for {NPXY} signals. {YXXO} and {DXXLL} signals bind in an extended conformation to the mu2 subunit of {AP-2} and the {VHS} domain of the {GGAs}, respectively. Phosphorylation events regulate signal recognition. In addition to peptide motifs, ubiquitination of cytosolic lysine residues also serves as a signal for sorting at various stages of the endosomal-lysosomal system. Conjugated ubiquitin is recognized by {UIM}, {UBA}, or {UBC} domains present within many components of the internalization and lysosomal targeting machinery. This complex array of signals and recognition proteins ensures the dynamic but accurate distribution of transmembrane proteins to different compartments of the endosomal-lysosomal system.},

Data sharing and reuse in some fields, however, has proven to be a difficult problem. This paper argues that the development of effective {CSCW} systems to support data sharing in work groups requires a better understanding of the use of data in practice. Drawing on our work with three scientific disciplines, we show that data play two general roles in scientific communities: 1) they serve as evidence to support scientific inquiry, and 2) they make a social contribution to the establishment and maintenance of communities of practice. A clearer consideration and understanding of these roles can contribute to the design of more effective data sharing systems. We suggest that this can be achieved through supporting social interaction around data abstractions, reaching beyond current metadata models, and supporting the social roles of data.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} In Caenorhabditis elegans, injection of double-stranded {RNA} ({dsRNA)} results in the specific inactivation of genes containing homologous sequences, a technique termed {RNA-mediated} interference ({RNAi).} It has previously been shown that {RNAi} can also be achieved by feeding worms Escherichia coli expressing {dsRNA} corresponding to a specific gene; this mode of {dsRNA} introduction is conventionally considered to be less efficient than direct injection, however, and has therefore seen limited use, even though it is considerably less labor-intensive. {RESULTS:} Here we present an optimized feeding method that results in phenotypes at least as strong as those produced by direct injection of {dsRNA} for embryonic lethal genes, and stronger for genes with post-embryonic phenotypes. In addition, the interference effect generated by feeding can be titrated to uncover a series of hypomorphic phenotypes informative about the functions of a given gene. Using this method, we screened 86 random genes on consecutive cosmids and identified functions for 13 new genes. These included two genes producing an uncoordinated phenotype (a previously uncharacterized {POU} homeodomain gene, ceh-6, and a gene encoding a {MADS-box} protein) and one gene encoding a novel protein that results in a high-incidence-of-males phenotype. {CONCLUSIONS:} {RNAi} by feeding can provide significant information about the functions of an individual gene beyond that provided by injection. Moreover, it can be used for special applications for which injection or the use of mutants is sometimes impracticable (for example, titration, biochemistry and large-scale screening). Thus, {RNAi} by feeding should make possible new experimental approaches for the use of genomic sequence information.},

The largest and most continuous   Andean bear population in Peru is located on the eastern slopes of the   Oriental Range, including Departamento Puno, where most reports are   based only on surveys. We describe two indirect records of Andean bear's   presence from Departamento Puno, obtained on August 2009. The first   record is a scat with seeds belonging to the family Lauraceae, and found   in Yanacocha; the second record consists of some bear's claw marks found   in Challohuma, which represents also the southernmost confirmed record   of the Spectacled bear in Peru. Also our records confirm a continuous   distribution of this species on the eastern Andean slopes from southern   Peru to northwestern Bolivia. Furthermore, these records, found very   close to the highly diverse Bahuaja Sonene National Park ({BSNP)}, suggest   it is very important to establish conservation strategies both within   and outside of {BSNP's} buffer zone.},

	abstract = {The nonspecific lipid transfer protein sterol carrier protein 2 ({SCP2)} is involved in organellar fatty acid metabolism. A hydrophobic cavity in the structure of {SCP2} accommodates a wide variety of apolar ligands such as cholesterol derivatives or fatty acyl-coenzyme A ({CoA)} conjugates. The properties of this nonspecific lipid binding pocket are explored using {NMR} chemical shift perturbations, paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, amide hydrogen exchange, and {15N} relaxation measurements. A common binding cavity shared by different physiological ligands is identified. {NMR} relaxation measurements reveal that residues in the three C-terminal alpha-helices within the lipid binding region exhibit mobility at fast (picosecond to nanosecond) and slow (microsecond to millisecond) time scales. Ligand binding is associated with a considerable loss of peptide backbone mobility. The observed conformational dynamics in {SCP2} may play a role for the access of hydrophobic ligands to an occluded binding pocket. The C-terminal peroxisomal targeting signal of {SCP2} is specifically recognized by the Pex5p receptor protein, which conducts cargo proteins toward the peroxisomal organelle. Neither the C-terminal targeting signal nor the N-terminal precursor sequence interferes with lipid binding by {SCP2.} The alpha-helices involved in lipid binding also mediate a secondary interaction interface with the Pex5p receptor. Silencing of conformational dynamics of the peptide backbone in these helices upon either lipid or Pex5p binding might communicate the loading state of the cargo protein to the targeting receptor.},

	abstract = {Employing a monoclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal peptide of glucose transporter molecule 1 (Glut1), we identified a approximately 30-{kDa} polypeptide which coimmunoprecipitated with Glut1 from sample of human red blood cells ({RBC)} membranes. The approximately 30-{kDa} polypeptide reacted with an antibody directed against stomatin, an integral plasma membrane protein which is also present at a high abundance in the human {RBC} plasma membrane. Likewise, employing anti-stomatin antibody, we found that Glut1 coimmunoprecipitated with stomatin from samples of {RBC} membranes. However, neither band 3, which is the most abundant integral membrane protein in the {RBC}, nor actin coimmunoprecipitated with Glut1, indicating a specific interaction between Glut1 and stomatin. Similar to the results obtained in the {RBC}, Glut1 and stomatin immunoprecipitated with each other in lysates of Clone 9 cells, a rat liver cell line in which Glut1 is expressed at approximately 1/200 the level present in {RBC.} Employing conditions that resulted in immunoprecipitation of approximately 10\% of Glut1 in {RBC} membranes led to a approximately 3\% coimmunoprecipitation of stomatin. A mixed population of Clone 9 cells stably transfected with a plasmid overexpressing the mouse stomatin exhibited 30 +/- 3\% reduction in the basal rate of glucose transport compared to control cells or cells stably transfected with the empty vector. The above results suggest that stomatin is closely associated with Glut1 in the plasma membrane and that overexpression of stomatin results in a depression in the basal rate of glucose transport.},

	abstract = {{HflK} and {HflC} are plasma membrane proteins of Escherichia coli, each having a large C-terminal domain exposed to the periplasmic space and an N-terminally located transmembrane segment, which should act as a signal anchor sequence for their biogenesis. They form a complex, {HflKC.} We studied in vivo processes of biogenesis of this pair of membrane proteins. Translocation of the C-terminal domains across the membrane, as assessed by their accessibility to externally added protease, was completed within 1 min after the synthesis in wild-type cells as well as in the {secB} mutant cells or in the {FtsY-depleted} cells. In contrast, translocation of these domains was retarded markedly when sodium azide was added to inhibit {SecA} {ATPase} and blocked almost completely in {secY-} or {secD-defective} mutant cells. Thus, although targeting of these membrane proteins depends neither on the {SecB} chaperone nor on the {SRP} pathway, their translocation occurs exclusively via the Sec translocase complex. Translocated {HflK} molecules were then folded into a partially protease-resistant conformation, taking a few minutes, and this folding was induced upon association with {HflC.} Singly expressed {HflK} and {HflC} were unstable in vivo and periplasmic proteases {DegP} and Prc were involved in the degradation of the {HflK} subunit. We characterized several {hflA} alleles isolated in early studies; they alter the {HflK} or the {HflC} sequence and destabilize the {HflKC} complex.},

Developmental data indicate that domestic dogs first begin to mix sounds by successive sound emissions at about 10 days of age and later by superimposition between 2 and 3 weeks of age.

All previous strains of C. elegans with altered responses to anesthetics have been identified by screening the response to halothane. The current study was designed to identify classes of mutations by screening for alterations in sensitivity to enflurane, isoflurane, and diethylether. {METHODS:} Nematodes were mutated and the resulting mutant strains were screened for immobility in low doses of enflurane, isoflurane, or diethylether. Concentrations of halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, and diethylether that anesthetized 50\% of the animals were determined in all mutations. Interactions of some new mutations with previously identified mutations were determined by construction of double mutants. {RESULTS:} Mutations in six genes were identified and were divided into two classes. One class primarily affected sensitivity to enflurane and isoflurane; a second class affected sensitivity to all of the volatile anesthetics studied. The effects of the latter group dominated the effects of previously identified mutations. {CONCLUSIONS:} The interaction of these mutations indicates that multiple sites of anesthetic action exist and that there are at least three such sites. A pathway for control of sensitivity to volatile anesthetics is proposed.},

        Abstract:
	  One of the primary outputs of the scientific enterprise is data, but many institutions such as libraries that are charged with preserving and disseminating scholarly output have largely ignored this form of documentation of scholarly activity. This paper focuses on a particularly troublesome class of data, termed dark data. {“Dark} data” is not carefully indexed and stored so it becomes nearly invisible to scientists and other potential users and therefore is more likely to remain underutilized and eventually lost. The article discusses how the concepts from long-tail economics can be used to understand potential solutions for better curation of this data. The paper describes why this data is critical to scientific progress, some of the properties of this data, as well as some social and technical barriers to proper management of this class of data. Many potentially useful institutional, social, and technical solutions are under development and are introduced in the last sections of the paper, but these solutions are largely unproven and require additional research and development.},

Bryan Heidorn describes what he calls the long tail of dark data, which is a reference to a graph showing the size of data sets on the Y-axis and the number of data sets of a particular size on the X-axis. The graph shows that the number of data sets of small size, what Heidorn calls “boutique data sets,” far outnumber the data sets of large size, but they are no less valuable. He calls them “dark data” because they “exist[s] only in the bottom left-hand desk drawer of scientists on some media that is quickly aging and soon will be unreadable by commonly available devices.”
This article was selected for this annotated bibliography because it is those dark data sets in the long tail that rarely get published, and, consequently, rarely get cited. There is a vast amount of useful data in these data sets that could be reused and synthesized for future research. Unfortunately, many times the data are unusable because of poor documentation. Another aspect of the value in these data sets lies in the fact they contain useful information on “failed” experiments, though no project is really a failure if it advances the field of knowledge, even if by saying this path leads nowhere. It has been proven that negative research results tend not to get published (Stern, J. M., \& Simes, R. J. (1997). Publication bias: evidence of delayed publication in a cohort study of clinical research projects. {BMJ}, 315(7109), 640-645.). Similar to reaping rewards of publishing data sets, this is another culture that must be changed if negative research findings are to be allowed to see the light of day.}

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} Stomatin-like protein 2 ({SLP-2)} is a novel and unusual stomatin homologue of unknown functions. It has been implicated in interaction with erythrocyte cytoskeleton and presumably other integral membrane proteins, but not directly with the membrane bilayer. We show here the involvement of {SLP-2} in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma ({ESCC)}, lung cancer, laryngeal cancer, and endometrial adenocarcinoma and the effects of {SLP-2} on {ESCC} cells. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN:} Previous work of {cDNA} microarray in our laboratory revealed that {SLP-2} was significantly up-regulated in {ESCC.} The expression of {SLP-2} was further evaluated in human {ESCC}, lung cancer, laryngeal cancer, and endometrial adenocarcinoma by semiquantitative reverse transcription-{PCR}, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Mutation detection of {SLP-2} exons was done by {PCR} and automated sequencing. Antisense {SLP-2} eukaryotic expression plasmids were constructed and transfected into human {ESCC} cell line {KYSE450.} 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, clonogenecity assay, flow cytometry assay, nude mice tumorigenetic assay, and cell attachment assay were done to investigate the roles of {SLP-2} gene. {RESULTS:} All tumor types we tested showed overexpression of {SLP-2} compared with their normal counterparts (P {\textless} or = 0.05). Moreover, immunohistochemistry analysis of mild dysplasia, severe dysplasia, and {ESCC} showed that overexpression of {SLP-2} occurred in premalignant lesions. Mutation analysis indicated that no mutation was found in {SLP-2} exons. {KYSE450} cells transfected with antisense {SLP-2} showed decreased cell growth, proliferation, tumorigenecity, and cell adhesion. {CONCLUSIONS:} {SLP-2} was first identified as a novel cancer-related gene overexpressed in human {ESCC}, lung cancer, laryngeal cancer, and endometrial adenocarcinoma. Decreased cell growth, cell adhesion, and tumorigenesis in the antisense transfectants revealed that {SLP-2} may be important in tumorigenesis.},

	abstract = {Neural pathways, which couple temperature-sensing neurons to motor and autonomic outputs, allow animals to navigate away from and adjust metabolism rates in response to the temperature extremes often encountered. ttx-3 is required for the specification of the {AIY} interneuron in the C. elegans neural pathway that mediates thermoregulation. ttx-3 null mutant animals exhibit the same thermotactic behavioral defect as that seen with laser ablation of {AIY} in wild type, suggesting that {AIY} does not signal in this mutant. ttx-3 encodes a {LIM} homeodomain protein. A ttx-3-{GFP} fusion gene is expressed specifically in the adult {AIY} interneuron pair, which connects to thermosensory neurons. In ttx-3 mutant animals, the {AIY} interneuron is generated but exhibits patterns of abnormal axonal outgrowth. Thus, the {TTX-3} {LIM} homeodomain protein is likely to regulate the expression of target genes required late in {AIY} differentiation for the function of this interneuron in the thermoregulatory pathway. The ttx-3-dependent thermosensory pathway also couples to the temperature-modulated dauer neuroendocrine signaling pathway, showing that ttx-3 specifies {AIY} thermosensory information processing of both motor and autonomic outputs.},

However, this is not   true in reality. The implication of this assumption is that the species   that contribute a larger bulk of digestible matters are underestimated,   while that of less digestible parts get overestimated and consequently   are portrayed as important food sources. This study experimentally   converts the percent contribution of important fruit items estimated   using 'indigestible fruit remains' in the scats into percent   contribution by 'digestible fruit content' using known dry weight of   digestible fruit contents per volume of indigestible items (estimated   using fresh fruit samples from the field). The percent composition of   various fruit items obtained using digestible fruit content is   signiicantly different from that derived using indigestible fruit   remains in the scats. Future studies could adopt the dry weight of   digestible matter as this method estimates the contribution of various   food items to the diet of bears more accurately.},

This natural variation in behaviour is associated with a single residue difference in {NPR-1}, a predicted G-protein-coupled neuropeptide receptor related to Neuropeptide Y receptors. Here we show that the {NPR-1} isoform associated with solitary feeding acts in neurons exposed to the body fluid to inhibit social feeding. Furthermore, suppressing the activity of these neurons, called {AQR}, {PQR} and {URX}, using an activated K(+) channel, inhibits social feeding. {NPR-1} activity in {AQR}, {PQR} and {URX} neurons seems to suppress social feeding by antagonizing signalling through a cyclic {GMP-gated} ion channel encoded by tax-2 and tax-4. We show that mutations in tax-2 or tax-4 disrupt social feeding, and that tax-4 is required in several neurons for social feeding, including one or more of {AQR}, {PQR} and {URX.} The {AQR}, {PQR} and {URX} neurons are unusual in C. elegans because they are directly exposed to the pseudocoelomic body fluid. Our data suggest a model in which these neurons integrate antagonistic signals to control the choice between social and solitary feeding behaviour.},

	abstract = {Sterol carrier protein-2 ({SCP-2)} is a small intracellular basic protein domain implicated in peroxisomal beta-oxidation. We extend our knowledge of plant {SCP-2} by characterizing {SCP-2} from Euphorbia lagascae. This protein consists of 122 amino acids including a {PTS1} peroxisomal targeting signal. It has a molecular mass of 13.6 {kDa} and a {pI} of 9.5. It shares 67\% identity and 84\% similarity with {SCP-2} from Arabidopsis thaliana. Proteomic analysis revealed that E. lagascae {SCP-2} accumulates in the endosperm during seed germination. It showed in vitro transfer activity of {BODIPY-phosphatidylcholine} ({BODIPY-PC).} The transfer of {BODIPY-PC} was almost completely inhibited after addition of phosphatidylinositol, palmitic acid, stearoyl-{CoA} and vernolic acid, whereas sterols only had a very marginal inhibitory effect. We used protein modelling and site-directed mutagenesis to investigate why the {BODIPY-PC} transfer mediated by E. lagascae {SCP-2} is not sensitive to sterols, whereas the transfer mediated by A. thaliana {SCP-2} shows sterol sensitivity. Protein modelling suggested that the ligand-binding cavity of A. thaliana {SCP-2} has four methionines (Met12, 14, 15 and 100), which are replaced by leucines (Leu11, 13, 14 and 99) in E. lagascae {SCP-2.} Changing Leu99 to Met99 was sufficient to convert E. lagascae {SCP-2} into a sterol-sensitive {BODIPY-PC-transfer} protein, and correspondingly, changing Met100 to Leu100 abolished the sterol sensitivity of A. thaliana {SCP-2.}},

Of the five widespread canid species present, one is Data Deficient, three are considered widespread although habitat selection could limit their area of occupancy, and distribution maps available are coarse for conservation planning. This study identifies biogeographic patterns in North-African canids through the combination of high resolution presence data with 16 environmental factors. Predictive models trained in north-west Africa are projected to all North Africa. canids exhibited distinct biogeographical affinities. {GIS} tools and Maximum Entropy models identify a mixture of climatic and habitat factors as main predictors of species occurrence. Suitable habitats for North-African canids are mostly fragmented: probable occurrence was identified for Canis aureus in Saharan peripheral regions and mountains, for Vulpes pallida in a narrow band along the Sahel and in southern Saharan mountains, for Vulpes rueppellii throughout the Sahara, for Vulpes vulpes in northern Africa until the Sahara northern limit, and for Vulpes zerda in almost all Sahara. Areas of potential sympatry between species with similar niches and parapatric ranges are identified along relatively narrow bands. The small pixel size of projections allows the identification of suitable refuges for species otherwise absent in the driest Saharan habitats, providing framework data for the definition of the global conservation status of V. pallida, and conservation strategies for the guild. The biological value of Saharan mountains is emphasised as they constitute isolated suitable areas. Ecological-niche based models should be developed for other endangered Saharan vertebrates.},

	abstract = {Mitochondria have been associated with aging in many experimental systems through the damaging action of reactive oxygen species. There is more, however, to the connection between mitochondria and Saccharomyces cerevisiae longevity and aging. Induction of the retrograde response, a pathway signaling mitochondrial dysfunction, results in the extension of life span and postponement of the manifestations of aging, changing the metabolic and stress resistance status of the cell. A paradox associated with the retrograde response is the simultaneous triggering of extrachromosomal ribosomal {DNA} circle ({ERC)} production, because of the deleterious effect these circles have on yeast longevity. The retrograde response gene {RTG2} appears to play a pivotal role in {ERC} production, linking metabolism and genome stability. In addition to mother cell aging, mitochondria are important in establishment of age asymmetry between mother and daughter cells. The results more generally point to the existence of a mechanism to "filter" damaged components from daughter cells, a form of checkpoint control. Mitochondrial integrity is affected by the {PHB1} and {PHB2} genes, which encode inner mitochondrial membrane chaperones called prohibitins. The Phb1/2 proteins protect the cell from imbalances in the production of mitochondrial proteins. Such imbalances appear to cause a stochastic stratification of the yeast population with the appearance of short-lived cells. Ras2p impacts this process. Maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential and the provision of Krebs cycle intermediates for biosyntheses appear to be crucial elements in yeast longevity. In sum, it is clear that mitochondria lie at the nexus of yeast longevity and aging.},

	abstract = {Changes in the environment cause both short-term and long-term changes in an animal's behavior. Here we show that specific sensory experiences cause changes in chemosensory receptor gene expression that may alter sensory perception in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Three predicted chemosensory receptor genes expressed in the {ASI} chemosensory neurons, srd-1, str-2, and str-3, are repressed by exposure to the dauer pheromone, a signal of crowding. Repression occurs at pheromone concentrations below those that induce formation of the alternative dauer larva stage, suggesting that exposure to pheromones can alter the chemosensory behaviors of non-dauer animals. In addition, {ASI} expression of srd-1, but not str-2 and str-3, is induced by sensory activity of the {ASI} neurons. Expression of two receptor genes is regulated by developmental entry into the dauer larva stage. srd-1 expression in {ASI} neurons is repressed in dauer larvae. str-2 expression in dauer animals is induced in the {ASI} neurons, but repressed in the {AWC} neurons. The {ASI} and {AWC} neurons remodel in the dauer stage, and these results suggest that their sensory specificity changes as well. We suggest that experience-dependent changes in chemosensory receptor gene expression may modify olfactory behaviors.},

Lipid rafts purified from hepatocyte plasma membranes by a nondetergent affinity chromatography method were: i) present at 33 +/- 3\% of total plasma membrane protein; ii) enriched in key proteins of the reverse cholesterol pathway [scavenger receptor class B type I ({SR-B1)}, {ABCA1}, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), sterol carrier protein-2 ({SCP-2)];} iii) devoid of caveolin-1; iv) enriched in cholesterol, sphingomyelin, {GM1}, and phospholipids low in polyunsaturated fatty acid and double bond index; and v) exhibited an intermediate liquid-ordered lipid phase with significant transbilayer fluidity gradient. Ablation of the gene encoding {SCP-2} significantly altered lipid rafts to: i) increase the proportion of lipid rafts present, thereby increasing raft total content of {ABCA1}, P-gp, and {SR-B1;} ii) increase total phospholipids while decreasing {GM1} in lipid rafts; iii) decrease the fluidity of lipid rafts, consistent with the increased intermediate liquid-ordered phase; and iv) abolish the lipid raft transbilayer fluidity gradient. Thus, despite the absence of caveolin-1 in liver hepatocytes, lipid rafts represented nearly one-third of the mouse hepatocyte plasma membrane proteins and displayed unique protein, lipid, and biophysical properties that were differentially regulated by {SCP-2} expression.},

However, methods of tracking and monitoring are known to affect some species negatively. On a wild population of habituated meerkats Suricata suricatta, we investigated the potential costs and consequences of carrying a radiocollar for small carnivores, focusing on detailed aspects of foraging behaviour and survival. Radiocollared individuals were no more likely to be predated than non-collared individuals in the same social group. We also found that collaring did not affect foraging efficiency, with collared individuals being equally efficient foragers (four measures) while wearing a collar compared with the pre-collaring period. To control for group-specific events, changes in foraging efficiency after collaring were compared with the behaviour of control individuals from the same group and no significant differences were found. In conclusion, we found no evidence to suggest radiocollars impact negatively on the bearer's welfare, survival or foraging ability.},

	abstract = {Human stomatin (band 7.2b) is a 31-{kDa} erythrocyte membrane protein of unknown function but implicated in the control of ion channel permeability, mechanoreception, and lipid domain organization. Although absent in erythrocytes from patients with hereditary stomatocytosis, stomatin is not linked to this disorder. A second stomatin homologue, termed {SLP-1}, has been identified in nonerythroid tissues, and other stomatin related proteins are found in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and plants. We now report the cloning and characterization of a new and unusual stomatin homologue, human {SLP-2} (stomatin-like protein 2). {SLP-2} is encoded by an approximately 1.5-kilobase {mRNA} ({GenBank(TM)} accession no. {AF190167).} The gene for human {SLP-2}, {HUSLP2}, is present on chromosome 9p13. Its derived amino acid sequence predicts a 38,537-{kDa} protein that is overall approximately 20\% similar to human stomatin. Northern and Western blots for {SLP-1} and {SLP-2} reveal a wide but incompletely overlapping tissue distribution. Unlike {SLP-1}, {SLP-2} is also present in mature human erythrocytes ( approximately 4,000 +/- 5,600 (+/- 2 {S.D.)} copies/cell). {SLP-2} lacks a characteristic {NH(2)-terminal} hydrophobic domain found in other stomatin homologues and (unlike stomatin) is fully extractable from erythrocyte membranes by {NaOH}, {pH} 11. {SLP-2} partitions into both Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble pools in erythrocyte ghost membranes or when expressed in cultured {COS} cells and migrates anomalously on {SDS-polyacrylamide} gel electrophoresis analysis with apparent mobilities of approximately 45,500, 44,600, and 34,300 M(r). The smallest of these protein bands is believed to represent the product of alternative translation initiated at {AUGs} beginning with nt 217 or 391, although this point has not been rigorously proven. Collectively, these findings identify a novel and unusual member of the stomatin gene superfamily that interacts with the peripheral erythrocyte cytoskeleton and presumably other integral membrane proteins but not directly with the membrane bilayer. We hypothesize that {SLP-2} may link stomatin or other integral membrane proteins to the peripheral cytoskeleton and thereby play a role in regulating ion channel conductances or the organization of sphingolipid and cholesterol-rich lipid rafts.},

The nematode's behavioral response to gradients of these attractants involves orientation and movement up the gradient, accumulation, and then habitutation. Comparison of the tracks of wild-type and mutant animals responding to gradients of attractants indicates that sensory receptors in the head alone mediate the orientation response and that the direction of orientation is determined by the lateral motion of the head. Therefore, the orientation response is a klinotaxis.},

Various substitutions in positions 2-/3-, 6-, and 7-shifted wavelengths while maintaining the environmental sensitivity of Nile red. In order to increase the solubility of the dyes in aqueous solutions, we attached butyric acid groups to the 2- or 3-{OH} position. In addition, phenothiazine dyes, which exhibited particularly long excitation properties, were synthesized and tested for the first time. All dyes showed Stoke's shifts of 70-100 nm and changes in excitation and emission of over 100 nm, depending on the hydrophobicity of the environment. Binding studies with bovine serum albumin and the non-specific lipid transfer protein {SCP2} revealed emission changes of more than 30 nm upon binding to the protein and a five-fold increase in emission intensity. Titration of the dye-loaded proteins with various lipids or drugs replaced the dye and thereby reversed the shift in wavelength intensity. This allowed us to estimate the lipid binding affinity of the investigated proteins. For {SCP2}, isothermal calorimetry ({ITC)} data verified the titration experiments. {NMR} titration experiments of {SCP2} with Nile red 2-O-butyric acid (1a) revealed that the dye is bound within the lipid binding pocket and competes with lipid ligands for this binding site. These results give valuable insight into lipid and drug transport by proteins outside and inside cells.},

To begin to resolve these issues, {MDCK} membranes were subfractionated by three different techniques to produce (i) detergent-resistant membranes ({DRM)} and detergent-soluble membranes ({DSM)}, (ii) nondetergent caveolae/rafts ({NDCR)}, and (iii) nondetergent, affinity-purified caveolae/rafts ({ACR)} and noncaveolae/nonrafts ({NR).} {ACR} exhibited the least cross contamination with other {PM} domains or intracellular membranes, in marked contrast to {DRM} that contained the highest level of cross contaminants. Spectral properties of dehydroergosterol ({DHE)}, a naturally occurring fluorescent sterol, showed that {ACR}, {NDCR}, and {NR} did not contain crystalline sterol, consistent with the lack of crystalline sterol in {PM} of intact cells. In contrast, {DRM} contained significant levels of crystalline sterol. Fluorescence polarization of membrane probes showed that {ACR} were the least fluid and had the highest transbilayer fluidity gradient, the most liquid ordered phase, and the sterol dynamics most responsive to sterol carrier protein-2 ({SCP-2).} In contrast, {DRM} had structural properties similar to those of {NR}, anomalous (very fast) spontaneous sterol dynamics, and sterol dynamics that were unresponsive to {SCP-2.} Differences between the structural and functional properties of {DRM} and those of the nondetergent preparations ({ACR} and {NDCR)} were not due to the presence of detergent. A nondetergent, affinity-purified ({ACR)} lipid domain fraction isolated from {MDCK} cells for the first time revealed unique structural (noncrystalline sterol, liquid-ordered, high transbilayer fluidity gradient) and functional (cholesterol dynamics) properties of lipid rafts as compared to nonrafts ({NR).} In summary, this study showed membrane microdomains (rafts/caveolae) isolated by three different methodologies have unique structural, functional, and organizational characteristics.},

	abstract = {Journal articles and databases are two major modes of communication in the biological sciences, and thus integrating these critical resources is of urgent importance to increase the pace of discovery. Projects focused on bridging the gap between journals and databases have been on the rise over the last five years and have resulted in the development of automated tools that can recognize entities within a document and link those entities to a relevant database. Unfortunately, automated tools cannot resolve ambiguities that arise from one term being used to signify entities that are quite distinct from one another. Instead, resolving these ambiguities requires some manual oversight. Finding the right balance between the speed and portability of automation and the accuracy and flexibility of manual effort is a crucial goal to making text markup a successful venture.

It was unknown why unc-1(lf) and unc-9(lf) mutants have similar phenotypes. We tested the hypothesis that {UNC-1} is a regulator of gap junctions formed by {UNC-9.} Analyses of junctional currents between body-wall muscle cells showed that electrical coupling was inhibited to a similar degree in unc-1(lf), unc-9(lf), and unc-1(lf);unc-9(lf) double mutants, suggesting that {UNC-1} and {UNC-9} function together. Expression of Punc-{1::DsRED2} and Punc-{9::GFP} transcriptional fusions suggests that unc-1 and unc-9 are coexpressed in neurons and body-wall muscle cells. Immunohistochemistry showed that {UNC-1} and {UNC-9} colocalized at intercellular junctions and that unc-1(lf) did not alter {UNC-9} expression or subcellular localization. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation ({BiFC)} assays suggest that {UNC-1} and {UNC-9} are physically very close at intercellular junctions. Targeted rescue experiments suggest that {UNC-9} and {UNC-1} function predominantly in neurons to control locomotion. Thus, in addition to the recently reported function of regulating mechanosensitive ion channels [5, 6], {SLPs} might have a novel function of regulating gap junctions.},

	abstract = {Despite recognition that the plasma membrane ({PM)} is comprised of lipid raft domains that are key organizing sites of multiple signaling pathways and other cell functions, limited information is available regarding the structure and function in sterol dynamics of these microdomains. To begin to resolve these issues, {MDCK} membranes were subfractionated by three different techniques to produce (i) detergent-resistant membranes ({DRM)} and detergent-soluble membranes ({DSM)}, (ii) nondetergent caveolae/rafts ({NDCR)}, and (iii) nondetergent, affinity-purified caveolae/rafts ({ACR)} and noncaveolae/nonrafts ({NR).} {ACR} exhibited the least cross contamination with other {PM} domains or intracellular membranes, in marked contrast to {DRM} that contained the highest level of cross contaminants. Spectral properties of dehydroergosterol ({DHE)}, a naturally occurring fluorescent sterol, showed that {ACR}, {NDCR}, and {NR} did not contain crystalline sterol, consistent with the lack of crystalline sterol in {PM} of intact cells. In contrast, {DRM} contained significant levels of crystalline sterol. Fluorescence polarization of membrane probes showed that {ACR} were the least fluid and had the highest transbilayer fluidity gradient, the most liquid ordered phase, and the sterol dynamics most responsive to sterol carrier protein-2 ({SCP-2).} In contrast, {DRM} had structural properties similar to those of {NR}, anomalous (very fast) spontaneous sterol dynamics, and sterol dynamics that were unresponsive to {SCP-2.} Differences between the structural and functional properties of {DRM} and those of the nondetergent preparations ({ACR} and {NDCR)} were not due to the presence of detergent. A nondetergent, affinity-purified ({ACR)} lipid domain fraction isolated from {MDCK} cells for the first time revealed unique structural (noncrystalline sterol, liquid-ordered, high transbilayer fluidity gradient) and functional (cholesterol dynamics) properties of lipid rafts as compared to nonrafts ({NR).} In summary, this study showed membrane microdomains (rafts/caveolae) isolated by three different methodologies have unique structural, functional, and organizational characteristics.},

	abstract = {The phasmids are bilateral sensory organs located in the tail of Caenorhabditis elegans and other nematodes. The similar structures of the phasmids and the amphid chemosensory organs in the head have long suggested a chemosensory function for the phasmids. However, the {PHA} and {PHB} phasmid neurons are not required for chemotaxis or for dauer formation, and no direct proof of a chemosensory function of the phasmids has been obtained. C. elegans avoids toxic chemicals by reversing its movement, and this behavior is mediated by sensory neurons of the amphid, particularly, the {ASH} neurons. Here we show that the {PHA} and {PHB} phasmid neurons function as chemosensory cells that negatively modulate reversals to repellents. The antagonistic activity of head and tail sensory neurons is integrated to generate appropriate escape behaviors: detection of a repellent by head neurons mediates reversals, which are suppressed by antagonistic inputs from tail neurons. Our results suggest that C. elegans senses repellents by defining a head-to-tail spatial map of the chemical environment.},

While it is often recognized that information gathered during scientific workflow execution can be used automatically to increase fault tolerance (via checkpointing) and to optimize performance (by reusing intermediate data products in future runs), it is perhaps more significant that provenance information may also be used by scientists to reproduce results from earlier runs, to explain unexpected results, and to prepare results for publication. Current workflow systems offer little or no direct support for these “scientist-oriented” queries of provenance information. Indeed the use of advanced execution models in scientific workflows (e.g. process networks, which exhibit pipeline parallelism over streaming data) and failure to record certain fundamental events such as state resets of processes, can render existing provenance schemas useless for scientific applications of provenance. We develop a simple provenance model that is capable of supporting a wide range of scientific use cases even for complex models of computation such as process networks. Our approach reduces these use cases to database queries over event logs, and is capable of reconstructing complete data and invocation dependency graphs for a workflow run.},

We used in this report the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system to identify and characterize the genes that are affected by ethanol exposure and to link those genes functionally into an ethanol-induced gene network. By analyzing the expression profiles of all C. elegans {ORFs} using microarrays, we identified 230 genes affected by ethanol. While the ethanol response of some of the identified genes was significant at early time points, that of the majority was at late time points, indicating that the genes in the latter case might represent the physiological consequence of the ethanol exposure. We further characterized the early response genes that may represent those involved directly in the ethanol response. These genes included many heat shock protein genes, indicating that high concentration of ethanol acts as a strong stress to the animal. Interestingly, we identified two non-heat-shock protein genes that were specifically responsive to ethanol. glr-2 was the only glutamate receptor gene to be induced by ethanol. {T28C12.4}, which encodes a protein with limited homology to human neuroligin, was also specific to ethanol stress. Finally, by analyzing the promoter regions of the early response genes, we identified a regulatory element, {TCTGCGTCTCT}, that was necessary for the expression of subsets of ethanol response genes.},

Chalfie, and {M.B.} Goodman. 2005. Nat. Neurosci. 8:43-50). They are members of a large family of ion channel proteins, collectively termed {DEG/ENaCs}, which are expressed in epithelial cells and neurons. In Xenopus oocytes, {MEC-4} can assemble into homomeric channels and coassemble with {MEC-10} into heteromeric channels (Goodman, {M.B.}, {G.G.} Ernstrom, {D.S.} Chelur, R. {O'Hagan}, {C.A.} Yao, and M. Chalfie. 2002. Nature. 415:1039-1042). To gain insight into the structure-function principles that govern gating and drug block, we analyzed the effect of gain-of-function mutations using a combination of two-electrode voltage clamp, single-channel recording, and outside-out macropatches. We found that mutation of A713, the d or degeneration position, to residues larger than cysteine increased macroscopic current, open probability, and open times in homomeric channels, suggesting that bulky residues at this position stabilize open states. Wild-type {MEC-10} partially suppressed the effect of such mutations on macroscopic current, suggesting that subunit-subunit interactions regulate open probability. Additional support for this idea is derived from an analysis of macroscopic currents carried by single-mutant and double-mutant heteromeric channels. We also examined blockade by the diuretic amiloride and two related compounds. We found that mutation of A713 to threonine, glycine, or aspartate decreased the affinity of homomeric channels for amiloride. Unlike the increase in open probability, this effect was not related to size of the amino acid side chain, indicating that mutation at this site alters antagonist binding by an independent mechanism. Finally, we present evidence that amiloride block is diffusion limited in {DEG/ENaC} channels, suggesting that variations in amiloride affinity result from variations in binding energy as opposed to accessibility. We conclude that the d position is part of a key region in the channel functionally and structurally, possibly representing the beginning of a pore-forming domain.},

	abstract = {C. elegans {OSM-9} is a {TRPV} channel protein involved in sensory transduction and adaptation. Here, we show that distinct sensory functions arise from different combinations of {OSM-9} and related {OCR} {TRPV} proteins. Both {OSM-9} and {OCR-2} are essential for several forms of sensory transduction, including olfaction, osmosensation, mechanosensation, and chemosensation. In neurons that express both {OSM-9} and {OCR-2}, tagged {OCR-2} and {OSM-9} proteins reside in sensory cilia and promote each other's localization to cilia. In neurons that express only {OSM-9}, tagged {OSM-9} protein resides in the cell body and acts in sensory adaptation rather than sensory transduction. Thus, alternative combinations of {TRPV} proteins may direct different functions in distinct subcellular locations. Animals expressing the mammalian {TRPV1} ({VR1)} channel in {ASH} nociceptor neurons avoid the {TRPV1} ligand capsaicin, allowing selective, drug-inducible activation of a specific behavior.},

	abstract = {The North Bilaspur forest division harbour large number of sloth bears.   Due to habitat loss, fragmentation and encroachment of, forests,and   interspersion of crop fields, the bear population causing lot of   nuisance. Incidence of human killing and mauling by bears and   retaliatory killing of bears are quite frequent. Sloth bears were radio   collared in order to know movement patterns in such disturbed and   unprotected areas so that management of these bears can be done in   efficient and scientific manner. Six sloth bears were radio collared   during the study but only three bears could be monitored for longer   period as two of them lost collar and one died. As compare to Protected   Areas in Chitwan National Park, Nepal and Mudumalai Wildlife sanctuary   bears covered large home ranges. Male bears showed 22.33 km(2) and 20.01   km(2) home range at 95\% {MCP} whereas female had 7.8 km(2) which was   significantly less to the area covered by males. gears were found to   spent much of their time in human habitation and agriculture fields.   Habitats loss, fragmentation of forests, and less food availability were   the major reason behind movement of bears in human inhabited areas and   thus resulted in high rate of conflict. It is suggested that fruit   bearing species should be planted in the forest areas to restore the   sloth bear habitats along with providing protection to the large   contiguous patches of forests. The sloth bear population from isolated   den sites should be trauslocated to other suitable areas for reducing   human-bear conflict as well as for the conservation of sloth bears.},

Here we demonstrate that prohibitin can function as a potent inhibitor of {DNA} replication by interacting with members of Minichromosome maintenance complex of proteins ({MCM2-7).} The data presented here indicates that prohibitin can physically interact with {MCM2}, {MCM5} and {MCM7} in in vitro {GST} binding assays as well as in {MCF-7} cells as seen by immunoprecipitation-western blot experiments. The association was cell cycle dependent, and more pronounced 4-8 hours after serum stimulation of quiescent cells. Prohibitin associated more robustly with {MCM2} and {MCM5} compared to {MCM7}, suggesting that prohibitin mainly interacts with the regulatory subunits of the {MCM} complex. Confirming these results, prohibitin was found to co-localize with {MCM2}, {MCM5} and {MCM7} in {MCF-7} cells, as seen by double immunofluorescence experiments. Further, Prohibitin strongly inhibited {DNA} replication in an in vitro replication assay. These results strongly suggest that prohibitin effectively represses replication by interacting with the components of mammalian replication machinery and this might contribute to the growth regulatory properties of prohibitin.},

To better understand the origin and evolution of reggie/flotillin structure and function, we searched databases for reggie/flotillin and {SPFH-like} proteins in organisms at the base and beyond the animal kingdom, and used the resulting dataset to compare their structural and functional domains. Our analysis shows that the {SPFH} grouping has little phylogenetic support, probably due to convergent evolution of its members. We also find that reggie/flotillin homologues are highly conserved among metazoans but are absent in plants, fungi and bacteria, where only proteins with "reggie-like" domains can be found. However, despite their low sequence similarities, reggie/flotillin and "reggie-like" domains appear to subserve related functions, suggesting that their basic biological role was acquired independently during evolution.},

	abstract = {Objectives A. Identify the current state of data management needs of academic biomedical researchers. B. Explore their anticipated data management and analysis needs. C. Identify barriers to addressing those needs.
Design A multimodal needs analysis was conducted using a combination of an online survey and in-depth one-on-one semi-structured interviews. Subjects were recruited via an e-mail list representing a wide range of academic biomedical researchers in the Pacific Northwest.
Measurements The results from 286 survey respondents were used to provide triangulation of the qualitative analysis of data gathered from 15 semi-structured in-depth interviews.
Results Three major themes were identified: 1) there continues to be widespread use of basic general-purpose applications for core data management; 2) there is broad perceived need for additional support in managing and analyzing large datasets; and 3) the barriers to acquiring currently available tools are most commonly related to financial burdens on small labs and unmet expectations of institutional support.
Conclusion Themes identified in this study suggest that at least some common data management needs will best be served by improving access to basic level tools such that researchers can solve their own problems. Additionally, institutions and informaticians should focus on three components: 1) facilitate and encourage the use of modern data exchange models and standards, enabling researchers to leverage a common layer of interoperability and analysis; 2) improve the ability of researchers to maintain provenance of data and models as they evolve over time though tools and the leveraging of standards; and 3) develop and support information management service cores that could assist in these previous components while providing researchers with unique data analysis and information design support within a spectrum of informatics capabilities.},

In July 2013 re3data.org lists 400 research data repositories and counting. 288 of these are described in detail using the re3data.org vocabulary. Information icons help researchers to easily identify an adequate repository for the storage and reuse of their data. This article describes the heterogeneous {RDR} landscape and presents a typology of institutional, disciplinary, multidisciplinary and project-specific {RDR.} Further the article outlines the features of re3data.org, and shows how this registry helps to identify appropriate repositories for storage and search of research data.},

	abstract = {Prohibitins comprise a remarkably conserved protein family in eukaryotic cells with proposed functions in cell cycle progression, senescence, apoptosis, and the regulation of mitochondrial activities. Two prohibitin homologues, Phb1 and Phb2, assemble into a high molecular weight complex of approximately 1.2 {MDa} in the mitochondrial inner membrane, but a nuclear localization of Phb1 and Phb2 also has been reported. Here, we have analyzed the biogenesis and structure of the prohibitin complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both Phb1 and Phb2 subunits are targeted to mitochondria by unconventional noncleavable targeting sequences at their amino terminal end. Membrane insertion involves binding of newly imported Phb1 to Tim8/13 complexes in the intermembrane space and is mediated by the {TIM23-translocase.} Assembly occurs via intermediate-sized complexes of approximately 120 {kDa} containing both Phb1 and Phb2. Conserved carboxy-terminal coiled-coil regions in both subunits mediate the formation of large assemblies in the inner membrane. Single particle electron microscopy of purified prohibitin complexes identifies diverse ring-shaped structures with outer dimensions of approximately 270 x 200 angstroms. Implications of these findings for proposed cellular activities of prohibitins are discussed.},

Mutants in three of the genes (class 1 genes: flr-1 X, flr-3 {IV}, and flr-4 X) are resistant to 400 micrograms/ml {NaF.} Furthermore, they grow twice as slowly as and have smaller brood size than wild-type worms even in the absence of fluoride ion. In contrast, mutants in the other two genes (class 2 genes: flr-2 V and flr-5 V) are only partially resistant to 400 micrograms/ml {NaF}, and they have almost normal growth rates and brood sizes in the absence of fluoride ion. Studies on the phenotypes of double mutants showed that class 2 mutations are epistatic to class 1 mutations concerning growth rate and brood size but hypostatic with respect to fluoride resistance. We propose two models that can explain the epistasis. Since fluoride ion depletes calcium ion, inhibits some protein phosphatases and activates trimeric G-proteins, studies on these mutants may lead to discovery of a new signal transduction system that controls the growth of C. elegans.},

Recently, semantic publishing has opened the possibility of a major step forward in the digital publishing world. For this to succeed, new semantic models and visualization tools are required to fully meet the specific needs of authors and publishers. In this article, we introduce the principles and architectures of two new ontologies central to the task of semantic publishing: {FaBiO}, the {FRBR-aligned} Bibliographic Ontology, an ontology for recording and publishing bibliographic records of scholarly endeavours on the Semantic Web, and {CiTO}, the Citation Typing Ontology, an ontology for the characterization of bibliographic citations both factually and rhetorically. We present those two models step by step, in order to emphasise their features and to stress their advantages relative to other pre-existing information models. Finally, we review the uptake of {FaBiO} and {CiTO} within the academic and publishing communities.},

A potential mechanism driving the evolution of vertebrate cognition early in the vertebrate lineage (550 million years ago) was genome duplication and subsequent diversification of postsynaptic genes. Here we report, to our knowledge, the first genetic analysis of a vertebrate gene family in cognitive functions measured using computerized touchscreens. Comparison of mice carrying mutations in each of the four Dlg paralogs showed that simple associative learning required Dlg4, whereas Dlg2 and Dlg3 diversified to have opposing functions in complex cognitive processes. Exploiting the translational utility of touchscreens in humans and mice, testing Dlg2 mutations in both species showed that Dlg2's role in complex learning, cognitive flexibility and attention has been highly conserved over 100 million years. Dlg-family mutations underlie psychiatric disorders, suggesting that genome evolution expanded the complexity of vertebrate cognition at the cost of susceptibility to mental illness.},

Here, we present a geometry to generate such a ‘tractor beam’, and experimentally demonstrate its functionality using spherical microparticles of various sizes, as well as its enhancement with optically self-arranged structures of microparticles. In addition to the pulling of the particles, we also demonstrate that their two-dimensional motion and one-dimensional sorting may be controlled conveniently by rotation of the polarization of the linearly polarized incident beam. The relative simplicity of this geometry could serve to encourage its widespread application, and ongoing investigations will broaden the understanding of the light–matter interaction through studies combining more interacting micro-objects with various properties.},

We also found that, although {PHB2} is predominantly expressed in the mitochondria of {HeLa} cells, it translocates to nucleus in the presence of estrogen receptor alpha and estradiol.

	abstract = {In this paper we present Triplify - a simplistic but effective approach to publish Linked Data from relational databases. Triplify is based on mapping {HTTP-URI} requests onto relational database queries. Triplify transforms the resulting relations into {RDF} statements and publishes the data on the Web in various {RDF} serializations, in particular as Linked Data. The rationale for developing Triplify is that the largest part of information on the Web is already stored in structured form, often as data contained in relational databases, but usually published by Web applications only as {HTML} mixing structure, layout and content. In order to reveal the pure structured information behind the current Web, we have implemented Triplify as a light-weight software component, which can be easily integrated into and deployed by the numerous, widely installed Web applications. Our approach includes a method for publishing update logs to enable incremental crawling of linked data sources. Triplify is complemented by a library of configurations for common relational schemata and a {REST-enabled} data source registry. Triplify configurations containing mappings are provided for many popular Web applications, including {osCommerce}, {WordPress}, Drupal, Gallery, and {phpBB.} We will show that despite its light-weight architecture Triplify is usable to publish very large datasets, such as {160GB} of geo data from the {OpenStreetMap} project.},

	abstract = {We previously identified a coregulator, repressor of estrogen receptor activity ({REA)}, that directly interacts with estrogen receptor ({ER)} and represses {ER} transcriptional activity. Decreasing the intracellular level of {REA} by using small interfering {RNA} knockdown or antisense {RNA} approaches in cells in culture resulted in a significant increase in the level of up-regulation of estrogen-stimulated genes. To elucidate the functional activities of {REA} in vivo, we have used targeted disruption to delete the {REA} gene in mice. The targeting vector eliminated, by homologous recombination, the {REA} exon sequences encoding amino acids 12 to 201, which are required for {REA} repressive activity and for interaction with {ER.} The viability of heterozygous animals was similar to that of the wild type, whereas homozygous animals did not develop, suggesting a crucial role for {REA} in early development. Female, but not male, heterozygous animals had an increased body weight relative to age-matched wild-type animals beginning after puberty. {REA} {mRNA} and protein levels in uteri of heterozygous animals were half that of the wild type, and studies with heterozygous animals revealed a greater uterine weight gain and epithelial hyperproliferation in response to estradiol (E2) and a substantially greater stimulation by E2 of a number of estrogen up-regulated genes in the uterus. Even more dramatic in {REA} heterozygous animals was the loss of down regulation by E2 of genes in the uterus that are normally repressed by estrogen in wild-type animals. Mouse embryo fibroblasts derived from heterozygous embryos also displayed a greater transcriptional response to E2. These studies demonstrate that {REA} is a significant modulator of estrogen responsiveness in vivo: it normally restrains estrogen actions, moderating {ER} stimulation and enhancing {ER} repression of E2-regulated genes.},

	abstract = {Marked alterations in cellular energy metabolism are a universal hallmark of the ageing process. The biogenesis and function of mitochondria, the energy-generating organelles in eukaryotic cells, are primary longevity determinants. Genetic or pharmacological manipulations of mitochondrial activity profoundly affect the lifespan of diverse organisms. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism during ageing are poorly understood. Prohibitins are ubiquitous, evolutionarily conserved proteins, which form a ring-like, high-molecular-mass complex at the inner membrane of mitochondria. Here, we show that the mitochondrial prohibitin complex promotes longevity by modulating mitochondrial function and fat metabolism in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that prohibitin deficiency shortens the lifespan of otherwise wild-type animals. Notably, knockdown of prohibitin promotes longevity in diapause mutants or under conditions of dietary restriction. In addition, prohibitin deficiency extends the lifespan of animals with compromised mitochondrial function or fat metabolism. Depletion of prohibitin influences {ATP} levels, animal fat content and mitochondrial proliferation in a genetic-background- and age-specific manner. Together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism regulating mitochondrial biogenesis and function, with opposing effects on energy metabolism, fat utilization and ageing in C. elegans. Prohibitin may have a similar key role in modulating energy metabolism during ageing in mammals.},

	abstract = {Sloth bears (Melursus ursinus) are the only myrmecophagous ursid. Ursids generally have large home ranges, often with widely separated seasonal ranges, whereas myrmecophagous mammals tend to have relatively small ranges for their body size. During 1990-93, we captured and radiocollared 18 sloth bears in Royal Chitwan National Park, Nepal, and tracked their movements for ≤3 years to assess whether sloth bears have large ranges like other bears, or if, as a result of their myrmecophagous foraging habits, their home ranges are smaller. Six of 8 males tracked ≥1 year exhibited seasonal home range shifts from grasslands and riverine forests of the alluvial floodplain to upland sal (Shorea robusta)-dominated forest during the onset of the monsoon (median movement date = 1 Jun); however, the 2 smallest males and most females did not make seasonal range shifts to sal forest. After the wet season (May-Nov), males returned to the alluvium (median return date = 14 Nov). Alluvial dry season ranges were smaller (P {\textless} 0.05) than wet season ranges, for bears that had moved to the sal and for those that did not, suggesting that alluvium offered a plentiful food supply during the dry season. We propose that digging for termites (sloth bears' primary food) was difficult in alluvium when the ground was saturated, prompting large males to move to better drained uplands. Home ranges of sloth bears in Chitwan were small compared with those of other ursids, and unlike typical ursids, sloth bears were not attracted to croplands outside the park, where they would have been subjected to risks of human-related mortality. Sloth bear populations may subsist in sanctuaries smaller than would be expected for an ursid, given sufficient alluvial habitat.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Stomatin is a membrane protein that was first isolated from human red blood cells. Since then, a number of stomatin-like proteins have been identified in all three domains of life. The conservation among these proteins is remarkable, with bacterial and human homologs sharing 50 \% identity. Despite being associated with a variety of diseases such as cancer, kidney failure and anaemia, precise functions of these proteins remain unclear. {RESULTS:} We have constructed a comprehensive phylogeny of all 'stomatin-like' sequences that share a 150 amino acid domain. We show these proteins comprise an ancient family that arose early in prokaryotic evolution, and we propose a new nomenclature that reflects their phylogeny, based on the name "slipin" (stomatin-like protein). Within prokaryotes there are two distinct subfamilies that account for the two different origins of the eight eukaryotic stomatin subfamilies, one of which gave rise to eukaryotic {SLP-2}, renamed here "paraslipin". This was apparently acquired through the mitochondrial endosymbiosis and is widely distributed amongst the major kingdoms. The other prokaryotic subfamily gave rise to the ancestor of the remaining seven eukaryotic subfamilies. The highly diverged "alloslipin" subfamily is represented only by fungal, viral and ciliate sequences. The remaining six subfamilies, collectively termed "slipins", are confined to metazoa. Protostome stomatin, as well as a newly reported arthropod subfamily slipin-4, are restricted to invertebrate groups, whilst slipin-1 (previously {SLP-1)} is present in nematodes and higher metazoa. In vertebrates, the stomatin family expanded considerably, with at least two duplication events giving rise to podocin and slipin-3 subfamilies (previously {SLP-3)}, with the retained ancestral sequence giving rise to vertebrate stomatin. {CONCLUSION:} Stomatin-like proteins have their origin in an ancient duplication event that occurred early on in the evolution of prokaryotes. By constructing a phylogeny of this family, we have identified and named a number of orthologous groups: these can now be used to infer function of stomatin subfamilies in a meaningful way.},

	abstract = {The structure and expression of rat sterol carrier protein 2 ({SCP2)} were studied by cloning and sequencing {SCP2} {cDNAs} and by hybridizing the {SCP2} {cDNA} to {RNA} from a variety of rat tissues. Initial screening of a rat liver {cDNA} library with an oligonucleotide probe derived from the rat {SCP2} protein sequence revealed an 825-base pair {cDNA} clone coding for the complete {SCP2} protein sequence. Our results suggest that rat liver {SCP2} is 143 amino acid residues long, including a 20-amino acid residue prepeptide (pre-{SCP2).} Using the rat {SCP2} {cDNA} as a probe for Northern blot hybridization analyses under high stringency conditions with rat liver poly(A) {RNA}, four {mRNA} species differing in their sizes and levels of expression are detected. The lengths of the corresponding {mRNAs} are 0.8, 1.4, 2.1, and 2.7 kilobases (kb), respectively. In all other tissues analyzed {mRNAs} hybridizing to the {SCP2} {cDNA} probe were detected in levels much lower than in the liver. In these tissues the vast majority of the expressed {SCP2} {mRNAs} consists of the 0.8-kb {mRNA.} Results from Southern blotting hybridization analyses with rat genomic {DNA} suggest that the four different {mRNA} species are products of a single gene. Extensive screening of rat liver {cDNA} libraries using rat liver {SCP2} {cDNA} probes led to the isolation of 10 additional clones, all of them containing {cDNA} insertions longer than 0.8 kb. Restriction mapping and nucleotide sequencing analyses of these {cDNAs} indicate that eight extend upstream of the {SCP2} {cDNA}, and two extend 5' as well as 3'. Translation of the sequence extending most upstream suggests that this {cDNA} is a nearly full-length {cDNA} coding for a protein of 547 amino acids ({SCP} chi). {SCP} chi contains a 404-amino acid amino-terminal extension as compared with pre-{SCP2} whereas its carboxyl-terminal part is identical with pre-{SCP2.} Sequencing of the 3' extension {cDNAs} suggests that polyadenylation had occurred 651 nucleotides downstream as compared with the remaining {cDNAs.} A probe from this region hybridizes to the 1.4- and 2.7-kb {mRNAs.} From our data we conclude that the 1.4- and 2.7-kb {mRNA} species are generated by alternative polyadenylation of the 0.8- and 2.1-kb {mRNAs}, respectively. In contrast, the 2.1- and 2.7-kb {mRNAs} contain an approximately 1300-nucleotide extension upstream of the 0.8- and 1.4-kb {mRNAs}, suggesting differential splicing of the primary {SCP2} gene transcript leading to expression of pre-{SCP2} and {SCP} chi from a single gene.},
